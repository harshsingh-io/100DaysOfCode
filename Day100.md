## Key Concepts

## **BodySync - Workout Model Animations**

### **Introduction**

The BodySync Workout Application is a fitness app that helps users perform a series of exercises with timed intervals. This documentation provides a detailed explanation of the application's code structure, functionality, and the tutorial's learning.

### **Code Overview**

The codebase consists of the following files:

- **ExerciseModel.kt**: This file defines the **`ExerciseModel`** class, which represents an exercise in the application. It includes properties such as **`id`**, **`name`**, **`image`**, **`isCompleted`**, and **`isSelected`**. The class provides getter and setter methods for these properties, allowing access to exercise information and status.
- **Constants.kt**: The **`Constants`** singleton object resides in this file and provides the **`defaultExerciseList()`** function. This function initializes and returns a list of default exercises. The function creates instances of **`ExerciseModel`** with predefined values and adds them to the **`exerciseList`** ArrayList.
- **activity_exercise.xml**: This XML layout file defines the user interface for the **`ExerciseActivity`** activity. It contains a **`GifImageView`** component with the ID **`ivImage`** that is responsible for displaying the exercise image.
- **ExerciseActivity.kt**: This file contains the **`ExerciseActivity`** class, which manages the workout flow within the application. It declares variables such as **`exerciseList`**, **`currentExercisePosition`**, **`restTimer`**, and **`exerciseTimer`**. The class includes methods to set up the rest view, exercise view, and progress bars. It also handles the logic for switching between exercises and displaying completion messages.

### **Tutorial Learning**

The tutorial for the BodySync Workout Application provides the following learning:

1. **ExerciseModel**: The **`ExerciseModel`** class demonstrates the concept of encapsulation by encapsulating the exercise information within a single object. It also highlights the usage of getter and setter methods to access and modify the properties of an exercise.
2. **Constants**: The **`Constants`** singleton object showcases the creation of a centralized place to store and access constant values. In this case, it provides a method to generate a default list of exercises.
3. **activity_exercise.xml**: The XML layout file demonstrates the use of the **`GifImageView`** component to display exercise images. Developers can modify this file to customize the user interface according to their design requirements.
4. **ExerciseActivity**: The **`ExerciseActivity`** class serves as the main activity responsible for managing the workout flow. It showcases the implementation of various features such as setting up the rest view, exercise view, and progress bars. It also demonstrates the utilization of timers to control the timing of exercises and rest periods.

### **Usage**

To integrate and utilize the BodySync Workout Application:

1. Create an instance of the **`ExerciseActivity`** class in your Android application.
2. Set the layout of the activity to the **`activity_exercise.xml`** layout file.
3. In the **`onCreate`** method of the **`ExerciseActivity`**, initialize the toolbar, set up the exercise list by calling **`Constants.defaultExerciseList()`**, and configure the rest progress bar by invoking **`setRestProgressBar()`**.
4. Implement the necessary user interface elements and logic to handle user interactions, such as button clicks, to navigate between exercises and rest periods.

### **Example**

Here is an example that demonstrates the usage of the BodySync Workout Application:

```kotlin
// Create an instance of ExerciseActivity
val exerciseActivity = ExerciseActivity()

// Set the layout of the activity
exerciseActivity.setContentView(R.layout.activity_exercise)

// Initialize the exercise list
exerciseActivity.exerciseList = Constants.defaultExerciseList()

// Set up the rest progress bar
exerciseActivity.setRestProgressBar()

// Handle user interactions and navigation between exercises and rest periods
// ...
```

## **Code Flow Explanation**

The BodySync Workout Application follows a specific code flow to manage the workout process. Let's walk through the flow step by step:

```kotlin
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    binding = ActivityExerciseBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
    setContentView(binding?.root)
    setSupportActionBar(binding?.toolbarExercise)
    if (supportActionBar != null) {
        supportActionBar?.setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true)
    }
    exerciseList = Constants.defaultExerciseList()
    binding?.toolbarExercise?.setNavigationOnClickListener {
        onBackPressed()
    }
    setRestView()
}
```

1. The **`onCreate`** method is the entry point of the **`ExerciseActivity`**. In this method, the layout is inflated and the content view is set using the **`ActivityExerciseBinding`**. The **`toolbarExercise`** is set as the support action bar with a back button. The **`exerciseList`** is initialized by calling the **`defaultExerciseList()`** function from the **`Constants`** singleton object. Finally, the **`setRestView()`** function is called to set up the initial rest view.

```kotlin
private fun setRestView() {
    binding?.flRestView?.visibility = View.VISIBLE
    binding?.tvTitle?.visibility = View.VISIBLE
    binding?.flProgressBarExercise?.visibility = View.INVISIBLE
    binding?.tvTitleExerciseName?.visibility = View.INVISIBLE
    binding?.ivImage?.visibility = View.INVISIBLE

    if (restTimer != null) {
        restTimer?.cancel()
        restProgress = 0
    }
    setRestProgressBar()
}
```

1. The **`setRestView()`** function is responsible for setting up the UI elements for the rest period. It makes the rest view, title, and exercise image invisible, and the progress bar and exercise name visible. It also cancels any ongoing rest timer and resets the rest progress to 0. Finally, it calls the **`setRestProgressBar()`** function to configure and start the rest countdown timer.

```kotlin
private fun setRestProgressBar() {
    binding?.progressBar?.progress = restProgress

    restTimer = object : CountDownTimer(10000, 1000) {
        override fun onTick(millisUntilFinished: Long) {
            restProgress++
            binding?.progressBar?.progress = 10 - restProgress
            binding?.tvTimer?.text = (10 - restProgress).toString()
        }

        override fun onFinish() {
            Toast.makeText(
                this@ExerciseActivity,
                "Now we will start the exercise.",
                Toast.LENGTH_SHORT
            ).show()
            currentExercisePosition++
            setupExerciseView()
        }
    }.start()
}
```

1. The **`setRestProgressBar()`** function configures the progress bar for the rest period. It sets the initial progress value and creates a **`CountDownTimer`** with a duration of 10 seconds and a tick interval of 1 second. On each tick, the rest progress is incremented, the progress bar and remaining time are updated, and the **`onFinish()`** method is called when the timer completes. In the **`onFinish()`** method, a toast message is displayed to indicate the start of the exercise, and the **`currentExercisePosition`** is incremented. Then, the **`setupExerciseView()`** function is called to set up the UI elements for the exercise.

```kotlin
private fun setupExerciseView() {
    binding?.flRestView?.visibility = View.INVISIBLE
    binding?.tvTitle?.visibility = View.INVISIBLE
    binding?.flProgressBarExercise?.visibility = View.VISIBLE
    binding?.tvTitleExerciseName?.visibility = View.VISIBLE
    binding?.ivImage?.visibility = View.VISIBLE

    if (exerciseTimer != null) {
        exerciseTimer?.cancel()
        exerciseProgress = 0
    }
    binding?.ivImage?.setImageResource(exerciseList!![currentExercisePosition].getImage())
    binding?.tvTitleExerciseName?.text = exerciseList!![currentExercisePosition].getName()

    setExerciseProgressBar()
}
```

1. The **`setupExerciseView()`** function is responsible for setting up the UI elements for the exercise. It hides the rest view elements and shows the exercise view elements, including the exercise name and image. If there is an ongoing exercise timer, it is canceled and the exercise progress is reset. The exercise image is set based on the resource ID of the current exercise from the **`exerciseList`**, and the exercise name is displayed. Finally, it calls the **`setExerciseProgressBar()`** function to configure and start the exercise countdown timer.

```kotlin
private fun setExerciseProgressBar() {
    binding?.progressBarExercise?.progress = exerciseProgress

    exerciseTimer = object : CountDownTimer(30000, 1000) {
        override fun onTick(millisUntilFinished: Long) {
            exerciseProgress++
            binding?.progressBarExercise?.progress = 30 - exerciseProgress
            binding?.tvTimerExercise?.text = (30 - exerciseProgress).toString()
        }

        override fun onFinish() {
            if (currentExercisePosition < exerciseList?.size!! - 1) {
                Toast.makeText(
                    this@ExerciseActivity,
                    "Here now we will take a rest.",
                    Toast.LENGTH_SHORT
                ).show()
                setRestView()
            } else {
                Toast.makeText(
                    this@ExerciseActivity,
                    "Congratulations! You have completed your today's Workout.",
                    Toast.LENGTH_SHORT
                ).show()
            }
        }
    }.start()
}
```

1. The **`setExerciseProgressBar()`** function configures the progress bar for the exercise duration. It sets the initial progress value and creates a **`CountDownTimer`** with a duration of 30 seconds and a tick interval of 1 second. On each tick, the exercise progress is incremented, the progress bar and remaining time are updated, and the **`onFinish()`** method is called when the timer completes. In the **`onFinish()`** method, a toast message is displayed. If there are more exercises remaining in the **`exerciseList`**, the user is prompted to take a rest by calling **`setRestView()`**. Otherwise, a toast message is displayed to indicate the completion of the workout.

### ExerciseModel.kt

```kotlin
package com.example.bodysync_workout

class ExerciseModel(
    private var id: Int,
    private var name: String,
    private var image: Int,
    private var isCompleted: Boolean,
    private var isSelected: Boolean
) {
    // Getter and Setter methods for id, name, image, isCompleted, and isSelected properties
    // ...

    // Other methods of the ExerciseModel class
    // ...
}
```

The **`ExerciseModel`** class represents a model for an exercise. It has private properties **`id`**, **`name`**, **`image`**, **`isCompleted`**, and **`isSelected`**, which are initialized through the primary constructor. The class provides getter and setter methods for each property to access and modify their values. These methods allow external code to get and set the state of an exercise object.

### Constants.kt

```kotlin
package com.example.bodysync_workout

object Constants {
    fun defaultExerciseList(): ArrayList<ExerciseModel> {
        val exerciseList = ArrayList<ExerciseModel>()

        // Creating ExerciseModel objects with specific values and adding them to the exerciseList
        val backwardAbdominalStretch = ExerciseModel(1, "Backward Abdominal Stretch", R.drawable.ic_backwards_abdominal_stretch, false, false)
        val bodyWeightTricepsExtension = ExerciseModel(2, "Body-Weight Triceps Extension", R.drawable.ic_bodyweight_triceps_extension, false, false)
        // ...

        exerciseList.add(backwardAbdominalStretch)
        exerciseList.add(bodyWeightTricepsExtension)
        // ...

        return exerciseList
    }
}
```

The **`Constants`** object provides a **`defaultExerciseList()`** function that returns an ArrayList of **`ExerciseModel`** objects. This function initializes a list of exercises by creating instances of the **`ExerciseModel`** class with specific values for each exercise. The created exercise objects are then added to the **`exerciseList`** ArrayList, which is eventually returned.

### activity_exercise.xml

```xml
<pl.droidsonroids.gif.GifImageView
    android:id="@+id/ivImage"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="0dp"
    android:src="@drawable/ic_lunge"
    android:visibility="invisible"
    app:layout_constraintBottom_toTopOf="@+id/tvTitleExerciseName"
    app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"
    app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
    app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="@+id/toolbarExercise" />
```

The **`activity_exercise.xml`** file defines the layout for the **`ExerciseActivity`** activity. It includes a **`GifImageView`** with an ID of **`ivImage`**. It is set to have a width that matches the parent and a height of 0dp. The **`android:src`** attribute is set to a drawable resource **`ic_lunge`**, which is the initial image displayed in the **`GifImageView`**. The initial visibility of the **`GifImageView`** is set to "invisible" through the **`android:visibility`** attribute. The **`app:layout_constraint...`** attributes specify the constraints for positioning the **`GifImageView`** within its parent layout.

This code flow ensures that the application progresses through each exercise and rest period with the appropriate timing. The user interface is updated accordingly to display the current exercise and remaining time. The flow allows for a seamless workout experience within the BodySync Workout Application.
