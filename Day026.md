## Key Concepts

Given an array arr[] of length **N**, find the length of the longest sub-array with a sum equal to 0.

**Examples:**

```
Input: arr[] = {15, -2, 2, -8, 1, 7, 10, 23}
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest sub-array with elements summing up-to 0 is {-2, 2, -8, 1, 7}

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no subarray with 0 sum

Input:  arr[] = {1, 0, 3}
Output:  1
Explanation: The longest sub-array with elements summing up-to 0 is {0}
```

**Naive Approach:** Follow the steps below to solve the problem using this approach:

- Consider all sub-arrays one by one and check the sum of every sub-array.
- If the sum of the current subarray is equal to zero then update the maximum length accordingly

```
Let us say prefixsum of array till index i is represented as Si .
Now consider two indices i and j (j > i) such that Si = Sj .

So, 
Si = arr[0] + arr[1] + . . . + arr[i]
Sj = arr[0] + arr[1] + . . . + arr[i] + arr[i+1] + . . . + arr[j]

Now if we subtract Si from Sj .
Sj – Si = (arr[0] + arr[1] + . . . + arr[i] + arr[i+1] + . . . + arr[j]) – (arr[0] + arr[1] + . . . + arr[i])
0 = (arr[0] – arr[0]) + (arr[1] – arr[1]) + . . . + (arr[i] – arr[i]) + arr[i+1] + arr[i+2] + . . . + arr[j]
0 = arr[i+1] + arr[i+2] + . . . + arr[j]

So we can see if there are two indices i and j (j > i) for which the prefix sum are same then the subarray from i+1 to j has sum = 0.

We can use hashmap to store the prefix sum, and if we reach any index for which there is already a prefix with same sum, we will find a subarray with sum as 0. Compare the length of that subarray with the current longest subarray and update the maximum value accordingly.
```

The steps mentioned below to implement the approach:

- Create *a variable (sum)*, *length (max_len)*, and *a hash map (hm)* to store the sum-index pair as a key-value pair.
- Traverse the input array and for every index,
    - Update the value of *sum = sum + array[i].*
    - Check every index, if the current sum is present in the hash map or not.
    - If present, update the value of *max_len* to a maximum difference of two indices (current index and index in the hash-map) and *max_len.*
    - Else, put the value *(sum)* in the hash map, with the index as a key-value pair.
- Print the maximum length *(max_len).*

## Code Snippets

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class LargestSubArraySum {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {15, -2, 2, -8, 1, 7, 10, 23};
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        //(sum, Index)
        int sum = 0;
        int lens = 0;
        for (int j=0;j<arr.length; j++){
            sum+= arr[j];
            if (map.containsKey(sum)){
                lens=Math.max(lens, j-map.get(sum));
            } else {
                map.put(sum, j);
            }
        }
        System.out.println(lens);
    }
}
```
