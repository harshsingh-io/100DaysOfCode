Topic: Longest Common Subsequences(Recursive Approach)

## What I Learned Today

Pseudo code Of Longest Common Subsequences.

## Key Concepts

# Longest Common Subsequence

Takes

```

X = < x_1,...x_m >

```

and

```

Y = < y_1,...y_n >

```

as input. Stores

```

c[i,j]

```

into table

```

c[0..m,0..n]

```

in row-major order. The array

```

b[i,j]

```

points to the table entry for optimal subproblem solution when computing

```

c[i,j]

```

.

```

LCS-Length(X, Y)

    m <- length[X]

    n <- length[Y]

    for i <- 1 to m

        c[i,0] <- 0

    for j <- 1 to n

        c[0,j] <- 0

    for i <- 1 to m

        for j <- 1 to n

            if (x_i == y_j) {

               c[i,j] <- c[i-1,j-1] + 1

               b[i,j] <- NW

               }

            else if (c[i-1,j] >= c[i,j-1]) {

               c[i,j] <- c[i-1,j]

               b[i,j] <- N

               }

            else {

               c[i,j] <- c[i,j-1]

               b[i,j] <- W

               }

```
