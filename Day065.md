## Key Concepts

### LOWEST COMMON ANCESTOR OF BINARY TREE (3rd Approach)

# **Problem Statement:**

Given a binary tree and a target node, find the distance between the root and the target node.

# **Example:**

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \   \
    4   5   6
             \
              7
```

Distance between root (1) and node 5: 2

# **Explanation:**

The distance between the root and a target node in a binary tree is the number of edges between them. In the given example, the distance between the root (1) and node 5 is 2, as we need to traverse the edges (1-2-5).

# **Approach:**

To find the distance between the root and a target node, we can follow these steps:

1. If the current node is null, return -1.
2. If the current node's data matches the target node's data, return 0.
3. Recursively call **`lcaDistance`** on the left and right subtrees.
4. If both the left and right subtree distances are -1, it means the target node is not present in the tree, so return -1.
5. If the left subtree distance is -1, return the right subtree distance plus 1.
6. Otherwise, return the left subtree distance plus 1.

# **Pseudocode:**

```
lcaDistance(root, n):
    if root is null:
        return -1

    if root.data is equal to n:
        return 0

    leftSubtreeDistance = lcaDistance(root.left, n)
    rightSubtreeDistance = lcaDistance(root.right, n)

    if leftSubtreeDistance is -1 and rightSubtreeDistance is -1:
        return -1
    else if leftSubtreeDistance is -1:
        return rightSubtreeDistance + 1
    else:
        return leftSubtreeDistance + 1
```

# **Dry Run:**

Given binary tree:

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \   \
    4   5   6
             \
              7
```

Finding the distance between the root (1) and node 5.

1. Check if the current node (1) is null. It is not null.
2. Check if the current node's data (1) matches the target node's data (5). They do not match.
3. Recursively call **`lcaDistance`** on the left subtree (2, 5).
    - Check if the current node (2) is null. It is not null.
    - Check if the current node's data (2) matches the target node's data (5). They do not match.
    - Recursively call **`lcaDistance`** on the left subtree (4, 5).
        - Check if the current node (4) is null. It is not null.
        - Check if the current node's data (4) matches the target node's data (5). They do not match.
        - Recursively call **`lcaDistance`** on the left subtree (null, 5).
            - The left subtree is null, so return -1.
        - Recursively call **`lcaDistance`** on the right subtree (null, 5).
            - The right subtree is null, so return -1.
        - Both the left and right subtree distances are -1.
        - Return -1.
    - Recursively call **`lcaDistance`** on the right subtree (5, 5).
        - Check if the current node (5) is null. It is not null.
        - Check if the current node's data (5) matches the target node's data (5). They match.
        - Return 0.
    - The left subtree distance is -1 and the right subtree distance is 0.
    - Return 0 + 1 = 1.
4. Recursively call **`lcaDistance`** on the right subtree (3, 5).
    - Check if the current node (3) is null. It is not null.
    - Check if the current node's data (3) matches the target node's data (5). They do not match.
    - Recursively call **`lcaDistance`** on the left subtree (null, 5).
        - The left subtree is null, so return -1.
    - Recursively call **`lcaDistance`** on the right subtree (6, 5).
        - Check if the current node (6) is null. It is not null.
        - Check if the current node's data (6) matches the target node's data (5). They do not match.
        - Recursively call **`lcaDistance`** on the left subtree (null, 5).
            - The left subtree is null, so return -1.
        - Recursively call **`lcaDistance`** on the right subtree (7, 5).
            - Check if the current node (7) is null. It is not null.
            - Check if the current node's data (7) matches the target node's data (5). They do not match.
            - Recursively call **`lcaDistance`** on the left subtree (null, 5).
                - The left subtree is null, so return -1.
            - Recursively call **`lcaDistance`** on the right subtree (null, 5).
                - The right subtree is null, so return -1.
            - Both the left and right subtree distances are -1.
            - Return -1.
        - The left subtree distance is -1 and the right subtree distance is -1.
        - Return -1.
    - Both the left and right subtree distances are -1.
    - Return -1.
5. Both the left and right subtree distances are -1.
6. Return -1.

The distance between the root (1) and node 5 is -1

## Code Snippets

```java
public static int lcaDistance(Node root, int n) {
        if (root == null) {
            return -1;
        }
        if (root.data == n) {
            return 0;
        }
        int leftSubtreeDistance = lcaDistance(root.left, n);
        int rightSubtreeDistance = lcaDistance(root.right, n);

        if (leftSubtreeDistance == -1 && rightSubtreeDistance == -1) {
            return -1;
        } else if (leftSubtreeDistance == -1) {
            return rightSubtreeDistance + 1;
        } else { //(rightSubtreeDistance == -1)
            return leftSubtreeDistance + 1;
        }
    }
```
