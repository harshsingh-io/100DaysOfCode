## Key Concepts

### **Strongly Connected Graph (Kosaraju's Algorithm):**

**Problem Statement:**
A strongly connected graph is a directed graph in which there is a directed path between every pair of vertices. The problem is to find all the strongly connected components (SCCs) in the graph.

****************Example:****************

![https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/SCC.png](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/SCC.png)

**Explanation of the Problem:**
Given a directed graph, an SCC is a subset of vertices in which there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex in the subset. The goal is to identify and print all SCCs in the graph.

**Approach: Kosaraju's Algorithm:**
Kosaraju's algorithm is a popular algorithm for finding strongly connected components in a directed graph.

The algorithm consists of the following steps:

1. Step 1: Get nodes in stack (Topological Sort):
    - Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) on the original graph and push nodes onto a stack in the order of their completion of DFS.
    - This step ensures that nodes with no outgoing edges are pushed first onto the stack, while nodes with outgoing edges are pushed later.
2. Step 2: Transpose the existing graph:
    - Create a transposed graph by reversing the direction of all edges in the original graph.
    - This step effectively swaps the roles of source and destination nodes in each edge.
3. Step 3: Do DFS according to stack nodes on the transposed graph:
    - Pop nodes from the stack one by one and perform a DFS on the transposed graph from each node that is not visited.
    - Each DFS from an unvisited node will identify a strongly connected component.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function kosaraju(graph, V):
    stack = new Stack()
    visited = new boolean[V]

    // Step 1: Get nodes in stack (Topological Sort)
    for i from 0 to V:
        if not visited[i]:
            topologicalSort(graph, i, visited, stack)

    transpose = new graph with the same number of vertices as the original graph

    // Step 2: Transpose the existing graph
    for i from 0 to V:
        for each edge (src, dest) in graph[i]:
            add edge (dest, src) to transpose

    // Step 3: Do DFS according to stack nodes on the transposed graph
    while stack is not empty:
        curr = stack.pop()
        if not visited[curr]:
            print "SCC ->"
            dfs(transpose, curr, visited)
            print new line

function topologicalSort(graph, curr, visited, stack):
    visited[curr] = true
    for each edge (src, dest) in graph[curr]:
        if not visited[dest]:
            topologicalSort(graph, dest, visited, stack)
    stack.push(curr)

function dfs(graph, curr, visited):
    visited[curr] = true
    print curr
    for each edge (src, dest) in graph[curr]:
        if not visited[dest]:
            dfs(graph, dest, visited)

```

**Complexity Analysis:**

- The time complexity of the algorithm is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
- The space complexity is O(V) for the stack and the visited array.

**Dry Run:**
Let's dry run the given example:

```
V = 5
graph:
0 -> 2, 3
1 -> 0
2 -> 1
3 -> 4
```

1. Step 1: Get nodes in stack (Topological Sort):
    1. **Topological Sort:**
    Topological sort is a linear ordering of the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge (u, v), vertex u comes before vertex v in the ordering. It is often used in tasks that require dependencies between elements to be satisfied.
        
        In the context of Kosaraju's algorithm, topological sort is used to get the order of nodes in the stack. The order is such that nodes with no outgoing edges are pushed onto the stack first, while nodes with outgoing edges are pushed later.
        
        The topological sort algorithm works as follows:
        
        1. Start with any unvisited node in the graph.
        2. Perform a DFS from that node.
        3. After visiting all neighbors of a node, push the current node onto the stack.
        4. Repeat steps 1-3 until all nodes are visited.
        
        At the end of the topological sort, the stack will contain the nodes in the desired order.
        
        In the given code, the **`topologicalSort`** function implements the topological sort algorithm, and the **`dfs`** function performs the DFS traversal.
        
    - Starting from node 0, perform DFS and push nodes onto the stack based on their completion of DFS.
    - The stack will contain: [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
2. Step 2: Transpose the existing graph:
    - Create a transposed graph by reversing the direction of edges in the original graph.
    - The transposed graph is:
        
        ```
        0 -> 1
        1 -> 2
        2 -> 0
        3 -> 0
        4 -> 3
        ```
        
3. Step 3: Do DFS according to stack nodes on the transposed graph:
    1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
    DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It is used to visit all the nodes in a graph, and it can be implemented recursively or iteratively using a stack.
        
        In the context of Kosaraju's algorithm, DFS is used to traverse the original graph and the transposed graph to identify strongly connected components.
        
        The DFS algorithm works as follows:
        
        1. Start with a source node.
        2. Mark the source node as visited.
        3. Process the source node (print or perform any required operations).
        4. For each unvisited neighbor of the current node, recursively call the DFS function on that neighbor.
        5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all nodes are visited.
    - Pop nodes from the stack and perform DFS on the transposed graph from unvisited nodes.
    - The strongly connected components are printed:
        
        ```
        SCC -> 4
        SCC -> 3
        SCC -> 0 2 1
        ```
        

Therefore, the strongly connected components in the given graph are [4], [3], and [0, 2, 1].

This algorithm successfully identifies all the strongly connected components in the graph.
