## Key Concepts

1. Explanation

- A segment tree is a data structure used to efficiently perform range queries and range updates on an array.

- It is a binary tree where each node represents a range of indices in the input array.

- The root node represents the entire array, and the leaf nodes represent individual elements of the array.

- Each internal node stores the result of some operation on its child nodes, typically the sum, minimum or maximum of its children's values.

- The segment tree allows us to perform range queries and updates by navigating down the tree to the appropriate range and retrieving or modifying the value stored in the node.

1. Implementation Steps

- Define an array to store the segment tree.

- Implement a method to initialize the size of the segment tree array based on the input array size.

- Implement a method to build the segment tree recursively.

- The build method takes as parameters the input array, the current node index, and the start and end indices of the current node's range.

- If the start and end indices are the same, assign the corresponding element in the input array to the current node in the segment tree.

- Otherwise, recursively build the left and right subtrees and compute the current node value by summing the values of its child nodes.

- Call the build method with the root node index and the full input array range.

- Traverse the segment tree array to confirm the construction is correct.

1. Pseudocode

```

function buildST(arr, i, start, end):

    if start == end:

        tree[i] = arr[start]

        return arr[start]

    mid = (start + end) / 2

    buildST(arr, 2*i+1, start, mid)

    buildST(arr, 2*i+2, mid+1, end)

    tree[i] = tree[2*i+1] + tree[2*i+2]

    return tree[i]

```

1. Complexity Analysis

- The time complexity of building a segment tree is O(n log n) where n is the number of elements in the input array.

- Each node in the tree is visited once during the construction, and there are log n levels in the tree.

- The space complexity of a segment tree is O(4n) which is the size of the segment tree array.

## Code Snippets

```java

public class SegmentTrees {

    static int[] tree;

    public static void init(int n) {

        tree = new int[4 * n];

    }

    public static int buildST(int[] arr, int i, int start, int end) {

        if (start == end) {

            tree[i] = arr[start];

            return arr[start];

        }

        int mid = (start + end) / 2;

        buildST(arr, 2 * i + 1, start, mid);

        buildST(arr, 2 * i + 2, mid + 1, end);

        tree[i] = tree[2 * i + 1] + tree[2 * i + 2];

        return tree[i];

    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};

        int n = arr.length;

        init(n);

        buildST(arr, 0, 0, n - 1);

        for (int i = 0; i < tree.length; i++) {

            System.out.print(tree[i] + " ");

        }

    }

}

```
