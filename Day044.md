## Key Concepts

**Approach:**
In the tabulation approach, we fill a matrix of size **`n x n`** where **`n`**
 is the number of matrices. The **`dp[i][j]`** entry of the matrix represents the minimum cost of multiplying matrices **`i`** to **`j`**. We start filling the matrix in a bottom-up fashion, computing the optimal costs for multiplying subproblems of increasing length. We use a triple nested loop where the outermost loop iterates over the subproblem lengths, the middle loop iterates over the starting indices of the subproblems, and the innermost loop iterates over the partition points.

**Implementation:**

1. Initialize the **`dp`** matrix with zeros.
2. Initialize the **`dp`** matrix for subproblems of length 1 (i.e., **`dp[i][i] = 0`**).
3. Fill the **`dp`** matrix in a bottom-up fashion for increasing subproblem lengths:
a. Iterate over the starting indices **`i`** of the subproblems (from 1 to **`n - length`**).
b. Compute the ending index **`j`** of the subproblem (i.e., **`j = i + length - 1`**).
c. Initialize **`dp[i][j]`** to infinity.
d. Iterate over the partition points **`k`** (from **`i`** to **`j - 1`**):
i. Compute the cost of multiplying matrices **`i`** to **`k`** (i.e., **`cost1 = dp[i][k]`**).
ii. Compute the cost of multiplying matrices **`k+1`** to **`j`** (i.e., **`cost2 = dp[k+1][j]`**).
iii. Compute the cost of multiplying the resulting two matrices (i.e., **`cost3 = arr[i-1] * arr[k] * arr[j]`**).
iv. Update **`dp[i][j]`** to the minimum of its current value and the sum of the three costs (i.e., **`dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], cost1 + cost2 + cost3)`**).
4. Return the optimal cost for multiplying matrices **`1`** to **`n-1`** (i.e., **`dp[1][n-1]`**).

**Here's the Pseudocode of Problem:**

```
function mcmTabulation(arr)
    n ← length(arr)
    dp ← 2D array of size n x n

    //initialization
    for i ← 0 to n-1
        dp[i][i] ← 0
    
    //bottom up filling
    for length ← 2 to n-1
        for i ← 1 to n-length
            j ← i + length - 1 //column
            dp[i][j] ← infinity
            for k ← i to j-1
                cost1 ← dp[i][k] // (i,k)
                cost2 ← dp[k+1][j] // (k+1,j)
                cost3 ← arr[i-1] * arr[k] * arr[j] // cost = i*b*d;
                dp[i][j] ← minimum of dp[i][j] and cost1 + cost2 + cost3
    
    return dp[1][n-1]
end function

```

**Explanation:**

- The function **`mcmTabulation`** takes an integer array **`arr`** as input which contains the dimensions of the matrices to be multiplied.
- The length of the array **`n`** is calculated using the **`length`** property of the array.
- A 2D array **`dp`** of size **`n x n`** is created to store the minimum number of operations required to multiply the matrices.
- The initialization step initializes the diagonal elements of **`dp`** to 0 because the cost of multiplying a single matrix is 0.
- The outer loop **`length`** iterates from 2 to **`n - 1`** because the minimum number of operations required to multiply a matrix chain of length 1 is 0, and the length of the chain can be at most **`n - 1`**.
- The inner loop **`i`** iterates from 1 to **`n - length`** because the length of the chain cannot exceed **`n`**, and the starting index of the chain can be at most **`n - length`**.
- The variable **`j`** is calculated as **`i + length - 1`** because the end index of the chain is **`i + length - 1`**.
- The **`dp[i][j]`** value is initialized to **`Integer.MAX_VALUE`** because this value will be updated with the minimum cost of multiplying the matrices in the chain.
- The loop **`k`** iterates from **`i`** to **`j - 1`** because the chain can be split at any point between **`i`** and **`j`**.
- The variables **`cost1`** and **`cost2`** are assigned the values **`dp[i][k]`** and **`dp[k + 1][j]`** respectively, which represent the minimum cost of multiplying the subchains from **`i`** to **`k`** and from **`k + 1`** to **`j`**.
- The variable **`cost3`** is assigned the value **`arr[i - 1] * arr[k] * arr[j]`** which represents the cost of multiplying the matrices **`i`** to **`k`** and **`k + 1`** to **`j`**.
- The minimum cost of multiplying the matrices from **`i`** to **`j`** is calculated using the formula **`dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], cost1 + cost2 + cost3)`**.
- The function returns the minimum number of operations required to multiply the matrices from the first matrix to the last matrix.

## Code Snippets

```java
public static int mcmTabulation(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length;
    int[][] dp = new int[n][n];

    // initialization
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dp[i][i] = 0;
    }
    
    // bottom up filling
    for (int length = 2; length <= n - 1; length++) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= n - length; i++) {
            int j = i + length - 1; //column
            dp[i][j] = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // answer initialization from infinity
            for (int k = i; k <= j - 1; k++) {
                int cost1 = dp[i][k]; // (i,k)
                int cost2 = dp[k + 1][j]; // (k+1,j)
                int cost3 = arr[i - 1] * arr[k] * arr[j]; // cost = i * b * d;
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], cost1 + cost2 + cost3);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[1][n - 1];
}
```

## Challenges Experienced

Must have a clear idea of patterns question because the logics of loop will be only clear if you have a good knowledge of patterns problems.
