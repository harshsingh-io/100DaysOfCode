## Key Concepts

**LONGEST INCREASING SUBSEQUENCES**

The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is a classical problem in computer science, which requires finding the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence of numbers, such that the elements in the subsequence are in increasing order.

A subsequence of a given sequence is a sequence that can be derived by deleting some or no elements from the original sequence, without changing the order of the remaining elements.

For example, given the sequence [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80], a possible longest increasing subsequence is [10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80], which has length 6.

Here are the steps to implement this approach:

1. Create a duplicate array of the original sequence.
2. Sort the duplicate array in non-decreasing order.
3. Create a hashset to store the unique values in the sorted duplicate array.
4. Create a new array to store the index of each element in the hashset.
5. Iterate through the original sequence and for each element, find its index in the hashset array.
6. Use a tabulation approach to find the length of the LCS between the original sequence and the index array. The value at the last index of the LCS is the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

Here is the pseudocode for the approach:

```java
javaCopy code
function lengthOfLIS(nums):
    // Create a duplicate array and sort it
    duplicate = copy(nums)
    sort(duplicate)

    // Create a hashset to store the unique values in the sorted array
    values = new HashSet(duplicate)

    // Create an index array to store the index of each element in the hashset
    index = new Array(length(values))
    for i = 0 to length(duplicate) - 1 do
        index[duplicate[i]] = i

    // Use a tabulation approach to find the length of the LCS between the original sequence and the index array
    dp = new Array(length(index) + 1)
    for num in nums do
        if num in values then
            idx = index[num]
            for i = length(dp) - 2 downto 0 do
                if idx == dp[i] then
                    break
                if idx > dp[i] then
                    dp[i + 1] = idx

    // Return the length of the longest increasing subsequence
    return index(dp[length(values)])

```

## Code Snippets

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.HashSet;

public class LongestIncreasingSubsequences {
    public static int lcsTab(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
        int n = arr1.length;
        int m = arr2.length;
        int dp[][] = new int[n + 1][m + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m + 1; j++) {
                if (i == 0 || j == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < m + 1; j++) {
                if (arr1[i - 1] == arr2[j - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                } else {
                    int ans1 = dp[i - 1][j];
                    int ans2 = dp[i][j - 1];
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(ans1, ans2);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][m];
    }

    public static int lis(int[] arr1) {
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
            set.add(arr1[i]);
        }
        int arr2[] = new int[set.size()];
        int i = 0;
        for (int num : set) {
            arr2[i] = num;
            i++;
        }
        Arrays.sort(arr2);
        return lcsTab(arr1, arr2);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {50,3,10,7,40,80};
        System.out.println(lis(arr));
    }
}
```
