## Key Concepts

### Adding Backgroung Image in Canva and UI of Gallery Image Selection

Today, I'm going to walk you through adding a background image and drawing functionality. Let's dive in!

Step 1: Set up the layout
To begin, open your code editor and create a new project. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies or libraries installed for drawing and handling image views.

Within your XML layout file, we'll use a frame layout to manage multiple layers. Start by creating a frame layout and setting its width and height. You can use 'match_parent' if you want the frame layout to fill the entire screen.

Inside the frame layout, we'll place two views: an image view for the background and a custom drawing view for our canvas. Set the image view's width and height to 'match_parent' as well, so it covers the entire frame layout.

To make sure the background image scales properly, set the scale type of the image view to 'centerCrop'. This will maintain the image's aspect ratio and crop it if needed.

Assign an ID to the image view for easy access in the code. For example, you can use 'backgroundImageView'.

Step 2: Handle the background image
In your Java or Kotlin file, retrieve a reference to the image view using its assigned ID.

Next, you'll need to load the desired background image into the image view. This can be done using an image loading library or manually by loading the image from a resource or URL. Set the image source accordingly.

Step 3: Implement drawing functionality
To enable drawing on the canvas, create a custom drawing view class that extends View. This view will handle user input for drawing.

Override the necessary methods, such as 'onDraw', to define the drawing logic. You can use the provided code as a starting point and add any additional functionality you require.

To make the drawing interactive, you'll need to handle touch events on the drawing view. Implement the necessary touch event listeners to track user input and update the drawing accordingly. For instance, you can handle the 'onTouchEvent' method to detect touch gestures like drawing lines or shapes.

Step 4: Enhance the feature
Feel free to enhance the interactive feature further by adding color options, erasers, or any other drawing tools you desire. Experiment and explore different possibilities to make the experience engaging for your users.

Remember to thoroughly test your app and handle any potential errors or edge cases that may arise.

That's it! You've now successfully created an interactive video feature that allows users to set a background image and draw on top of it. Have fun coding and let your creativity flow!

1. FrameLayout:
    - This is the root layout container that holds the interactive components.
    - It has an assigned ID of **`fl_drawing_view_container`**.
    - The layout width and height are set to **`0dp`**, which means it will expand to fill its parent's constraints.
    - A margin of **`5dp`** and padding of **`1dp`** are added for spacing and visual aesthetics.
    - The background is set to a drawable resource called **`background_drawing_view_layout`**.
    - It has constraints applied to position it above **`linearLayout2`**.
2. ImageView:
    - This view is responsible for displaying the background image.
    - It has an assigned ID of **`iv_background`** for easy access in code.
    - The layout width and height are set to **`match_parent`**, so it fills the entire FrameLayout.
    - The scale type is set to **`centerCrop`**, which maintains the image's aspect ratio and crops it if needed.
    - The source image is set to a drawable resource called **`image`**.
3. DrawingView:
    - This is a custom view called **`kt.harshsingh.doodleit.DrawingView`** that handles drawing functionality.
    - It has an assigned ID of **`drawing_view`** for easy access in code.
    - The layout width and height are set to **`match_parent`**, so it fills the entire FrameLayout.
    - The background color is set to a semi-transparent white color (**`#80FFFFFF`**), which gives a translucent effect.
4. ImageButton:
    - This is an image button used for selecting an image from the gallery.
    - It has an assigned ID of **`galleryButton`**.
    - The layout width and height are set to **`50dp`** to define its size.
    - The **`cropToPadding`** attribute is set to **`false`**, which means the padding won't affect the image's content.
    - The source image is set to a drawable resource called **`gallery_add_svgrepo_com`**.

Overall, the code sets up a layout hierarchy with a FrameLayout as the container. Inside the FrameLayout, an ImageView displays the background image, and a custom DrawingView allows users to draw on top of the image. Additionally, there's an ImageButton for selecting an image from the gallery.

## Code Snippets

```xml
<FrameLayout
        android:id="@+id/fl_drawing_view_container"
        android:layout_width="0dp"
        android:layout_height="0dp"
        android:layout_margin="5dp"
        android:padding="1dp"
        android:background="@drawable/background_drawing_view_layout"
        app:layout_constraintBottom_toTopOf="@+id/linearLayout2"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent"
        >
        <ImageView
            android:id="@+id/iv_background"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent"
            android:scaleType="centerCrop"
            android:src="@drawable/image"/>

        <kt.harshsingh.doodleit.DrawingView
            android:id="@+id/drawing_view"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent"
            android:background="#80FFFFFF" />
    </FrameLayout>
```

```xml
<ImageButton
                android:id="@+id/galleryButton"
                android:layout_width="50dp"
                android:layout_height="50dp"
                android:cropToPadding="false"
                android:src="@drawable/gallery_add_svgrepo_com" />
```
