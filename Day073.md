## Key Concepts

**Wildcard Matching Problem**

**Code Explanation:**
The given code solves the wildcard matching problem using a dynamic programming approach. It defines a function **`isMatch`** that takes two strings, **`s`** and **`p`**, as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string **`s`** matches the pattern **`p`**. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n * m), where n and m are the lengths of the input strings.

The algorithm uses a 2D array **`dp`** to store the intermediate results. The array **`dp`** has dimensions (n + 1) x (m + 1), where n is the length of string **`s`** and m is the length of pattern **`p`**. The extra row and column in the array are used for handling the base cases.

The algorithm follows a bottom-up approach, starting from the base cases and filling the array **`dp`** row by row. It uses nested loops to iterate over the characters of the string and pattern.

1. Initialization:
    - **`dp[0][0]`** is set to true since an empty string matches an empty pattern.
2. Handling cases where pattern is empty:
    - For each index **`i`** from 1 to n, **`dp[i][0]`** is set to false since a non-empty string cannot match an empty pattern.
    - For each index **`j`** from 1 to m, if the j-th character of pattern **`p`** is '*', **`dp[0][j]`** is set to the value of **`dp[0][j - 1]`**. This is because '*' can match an empty string or any number of characters.
3. Main DP loop:
    - For each index **`i`** from 1 to n and for each index **`j`** from 1 to m, the algorithm checks the following cases:
        - If the i-th character of string **`s`** is equal to the j-th character of pattern **`p`** or the j-th character of pattern **`p`** is '?', then **`dp[i][j]`** is set to **`dp[i - 1][j - 1]`**.
        - If the j-th character of pattern **`p`** is '*', then **`dp[i][j]`** is set to **`dp[i - 1][j]`** (matching '*' with the previous character in string **`s`**) or **`dp[i][j - 1]`** (ignoring '*' and matching it with an empty string).
        - Otherwise, **`dp[i][j]`** is set to false since the characters do not match.
4. Return the result:
    - The final result is given by **`dp[n][m]`**, which indicates whether the entire string **`s`** matches the pattern **`p`**.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function isMatch(s, p):
    n = length(s)
    m = length(p)

    dp = new 2D array with dimensions (n + 1) x (m + 1)

    dp[0][0] = true

    for i from 1 to n:
        dp[i][0] = false

    for j from 1 to m:
        if p[j - 1] == '*':
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1]

    for i from 1 to n:
        for j from 1 to m:
            if s[i - 1] == p[j - 1] or p[j - 1] == '?':
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            else if p[j - 1] == '*':
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] or dp[i][j - 1]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = false

    return dp[n][m]
```

**Dry Run:**

Let's dry run the given example:

```
s = "baaabab"
p = "*****dMa*****ab"
```

The lengths of **`s`** and **`p`** are **`n = 7`** and **`m = 16`**, respectively.

1. Initialization:
    - **`dp[0][0] = true`**
    - **`dp[i][0] = false`** for **`i = 1`** to **`n`** (no empty pattern can match a non-empty string)
    - **`dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1]`** if **`p[j - 1] == '*'`** (store the previous result for '*')
2. Main DP loop:
    - For each index **`i`** from 1 to n and for each index **`j`** from 1 to m:
        - For **`i = 1`** and **`j = 1`**:
            - **`s[0] = 'b'`**, **`p[0] = '*'`** (characters do not match)
            - **`dp[1][1] = false`**
        - For **`i = 1`** and **`j = 2`**:
            - **`s[0] = 'b'`**, **`p[1] = '*'`** (matches the previous character in **`s`**)
            - **`dp[1][2] = dp[0][2] = false`**
        - For **`i = 1`** and **`j = 3`** to **`m`**:
            - **`dp[1][j] = dp[0][j]`** (previous result for '*')
        - For **`i = 2`** to **`n`** and **`j = 1`** to **`m`**:
            - Repeat the above steps for the remaining indices
3. Return the result:
    - The final result is **`dp[n][m] = dp[7][16] = false`**

Therefore, the given string **`s`** does not match the pattern **`p`** according to the wildcard matching algorithm.

### **Coin Change Problem**

**Problem Statement:**
Given a set of coin denominations and a target sum, find the minimum number of coins required to make the target sum. Each coin can be used an unlimited number of times.

**Explanation of Problem:**
The coin change problem involves finding the minimum number of coins required to make a target sum using a given set of coin denominations. It is similar to the unbounded knapsack problem, where we have an unlimited supply of items and need to maximize or minimize a certain value.

In the coin change problem, we are given a set of coin denominations, represented by an array **`coins`**, and a target sum **`sum`**. Our goal is to determine the minimum number of coins needed to make the sum **`sum`** using the given coin denominations.

******************Examples:******************

```
Input: sum = 4, coins[] = {1,2,3}, 
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four solutions: {1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 2}, {2, 2}, {1, 3}. 

Input: sum = 10, coins[] = {2, 5, 3, 6}
Output: 5
Explanation: There are five solutions: 
{2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}.
```

**Approach: Unbounded Knapsack:**
The coin change problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach, specifically the unbounded knapsack algorithm. We can consider each coin as an item with its value equal to its denomination.

We create a 2D array **`dp`** with dimensions **`(n + 1) x (sum + 1)`**, where **`n`** is the number of coin denominations and **`sum`** is the target sum.

1. Initialization:
    - For **`i = 0`** to **`n`**, **`dp[i][0]`** is set to 1 since there is exactly one way to make a sum of 0 (by not including any coin).
    - For **`j = 1`** to **`sum`**, **`dp[0][j]`** is set to 0 since there are no coins available to make any positive sum.
2. Tabulation:
    - For **`i = 1`** to **`n`** and **`j = 1`** to **`sum`**:
        - If the **`i`**th coin denomination **`coins[i - 1]`** is less than or equal to **`j`**, we have two choices:
            - Include the **`i`**th coin and consider the remaining sum as **`j - coins[i - 1]`**.
            - Exclude the **`i`**th coin and consider the remaining sum as **`j`**.
            - The total number of ways to make the sum **`j`** is the sum of the number of ways in both choices.
        - If the **`i`**th coin denomination is greater than **`j`**, we can only exclude the **`i`**th coin, and the number of ways remains the same as in the previous row.
    - The value in **`dp[n][sum]`** represents the minimum number of coins required to make the target sum.
3. Return the result:
    - Return **`dp[n][sum]`**.

**Difference from Unbounded Knapsack:**
The main difference between the coin change problem and the unbounded knapsack problem is in the objective and constraints. In the unbounded knapsack problem, we aim to maximize the value of the knapsack while considering the weight constraint. In the coin change problem, we aim to minimize the number of coins while considering the sum constraint.

In the unbounded knapsack problem, we typically have an array representing the values of items and another array representing their weights. We calculate the maximum value that can be obtained while keeping the total weight below a certain limit.

In the coin change problem, we have a set of coin denominations, and our goal is to find the minimum number of coins required to make a given sum. We consider each coin as an item with its value equal to its denomination, and the weight constraint is replaced with the sum constraint.

**Code Explanation:**
The given code solves the coin change problem using the unbounded knapsack approach.

1. Initialization:
    - The 2D array **`dp`** is initialized with dimensions **`(n + 1) x (sum + 1)`**, where **`n`** is the number of coin denominations and **`sum`** is the target sum.
    - The base cases **`dp[i][0] = 1`** and **`dp[0][j] = 0`** are set as explained in the approach.
2. Tabulation Loop:
    - The nested loops iterate over **`i`** from 1 to **`n`** and **`j`** from 1 to **`sum`**.
    - If the **`i`**th coin denomination is less than or equal to **`j`**, the algorithm calculates the number of ways to make the sum **`j`** by including and excluding the **`i`**th coin.
    - If the **`i`**th coin denomination is greater than **`j`**, the algorithm can only exclude the **`i`**th coin, and the number of ways remains the same as in the previous row.
3. Return the result:
    - The result is given by **`dp[n][sum]`**, which represents the minimum number of coins required to make the target sum.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function coinChange(coins, sum):
    n = length(coins)
    dp = new 2D array with dimensions (n + 1) x (sum + 1)

    for i from 0 to n:
        dp[i][0] = 1

    for j from 1 to sum:
        dp[0][j] = 0

    for i from 1 to n:
        for j from 1 to sum:
            ithCoin = coins[i - 1]
            if ithCoin <= j:
                includeProfit = dp[i][j - ithCoin]
                excludeProfit = dp[i - 1][j]
                dp[i][j] = includeProfit + excludeProfit
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]

    return dp[n][sum]
```

**Complexity Analysis:**
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n * sum), where n is the number of coin denominations and sum is the target sum. This is because we iterate over **`n`** coin denominations and for each denomination, we iterate over **`sum`** values.

The space complexity is also O(n * sum) because we use a 2D array **`dp`** of dimensions (n + 1) x (sum + 1) to store the intermediate results.

**Dry Run:**

Let's dry run the given example:

```
coins = [1, 2, 3]
sum = 4
```

The number of coin denominations is **`n = 3`**, and the target sum is **`sum = 4`**.

1. Initialization:
    - **`dp[0][j] = 0`** for **`j = 1`** to **`sum`** (no coins available to make the sum)
    - **`dp[i][0] = 1`** for **`i = 0`** to **`n`** (one way to make a sum of 0 by not including any coin)
2. Tabulation Loop:
    - For **`i = 1`** and **`j = 1`**:
        - **`coins[0] = 1`**, **`1 <= 1`** (true)
        - **`includeProfit = dp[1][0] = 1`** (number of ways to make a sum of 1 using coin denominations [1])
        - **`excludeProfit = dp[0][1] = 0`** (no coins available to make a sum of 1)
        - **`dp[1][1] = includeProfit + excludeProfit = 1`**
    - For **`i = 1`** and **`j = 2`**:
        - **`coins[0] = 1`**, **`1 <= 2`** (true)
        - **`includeProfit = dp[1][1] = 1`** (number of ways to make a sum of 1 using coin denominations [1])
        - **`excludeProfit = dp[0][2] = 0`** (no coins available to make a sum of 2)
        - **`dp[1][2] = includeProfit + excludeProfit = 1`**
    - For **`i = 1`** and **`j = 3`**:
        - **`coins[0] = 1`**, **`1 <= 3`** (true)
        - **`includeProfit = dp[1][2] = 1`** (number of ways to make a sum of 2 using coin denominations [1])
        - **`excludeProfit = dp[0][3] = 0`** (no coins available to make a sum of 3)
        - **`dp[1][3] = includeProfit + excludeProfit = 1`**
    - For **`i = 1`** and **`j = 4`**:
        - **`coins[0] = 1`**, **`1 <= 4`** (true)
        - **`includeProfit = dp[1][3] = 1`** (number of ways to make a sum of 3 using coin denominations [1])
        - **`excludeProfit = dp[0][4] = 0`** (no coins available to make a sum of 4)
        - **`dp[1][4] = includeProfit + excludeProfit = 1`**
    - Repeat the above steps for **`i = 2`** and **`i = 3`**
3. Return the result:
    - The final result is **`dp[n][sum] = dp[3][4] = 4`**

Therefore, the minimum number of coins required to make the sum 4 using the coin denominations [1, 2, 3] is 4.

**Variation Problem of Coin Change:**
A variation of the coin change problem is to find the total number of distinct combinations that can be used to make the target sum using the given coin denominations.

To solve this variation, we need to modify the initialization step and the update condition inside the tabulation loop.

- Initialization: Instead of setting **`dp[i][0] = 1`**, we set **`dp[0][0] = 1`** and **`dp[i][0] = 0`** for **`i = 1`** to **`n`**.
- Update Condition: Instead of using **`dp[i][j] = includeProfit + excludeProfit`**, we use **`dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - ithCoin] + dp[i - 1][j]`**. This change accounts for the fact that we can include the **`i`**th coin multiple times to make the sum **`j`**.

The modified algorithm will give the total number of distinct combinations instead of the minimum number of coins required.
