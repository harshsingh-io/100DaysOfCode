## Key Concepts

### Union Of Two Arrays

we first create two arrays **`array1`** and **`array2`**. We then create two HashSet objects **`set1`** and **`set2`**. We then add all the elements from **`array1`** to **`set1`** and all the elements from **`array2`** to **`set2`**.

Next, we create a third HashSet object **`unionSet`** and add all the elements from **`set1`** to **`unionSet`** using the constructor that takes a Collection object as an argument. We then use the **`addAll()`** method of **`HashSet`** to add all the elements from **`set2`** to **`unionSet`**.

Finally, we print out the contents of **`unionSet`** to get the union of the two arrays.

### Intersection Of Two Arrays

we first create two arrays **`array1`** and **`array2`**. We then create two HashSet objects **`set1`** and **`set2`**. We then add all the elements from **`array1`** to **`set1`** and all the elements from **`array2`** to **`set2`**.

Next, we use the **`retainAll()`** method of **`HashSet`** to find the intersection of **`set1`** and **`set2`**. This method modifies **`set1`** to contain only the elements that are also in **`set2`**.

Finally, we print out the contents of **`set1`** to get the intersection of the two arrays.

### **Find Itinerary from a given list of tickets**

Given a list of tickets, find itinerary in order using the given list.

**Example:**

```
Input:
"Chennai" -> "Banglore"
"Bombay" -> "Delhi"
"Goa"    -> "Chennai"
"Delhi"  -> "Goa"

Output:
Bombay->Delhi, Delhi->Goa, Goa->Chennai, Chennai->Banglore,
```

It may be assumed that the input list of tickets is not cyclic and there is one ticket from every city except the final destination.

One Solution is to build a graph and do **[Topological Sorting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/topological-sorting/)** of the graph. The time complexity of this solution is O(n).

We can also use **[hashing](http://geeksquiz.com/hashing-set-1-introduction/)** to avoid building a graph. The idea is to first find the starting point. A starting point would never be on ‘to’ side of a ticket. Once we find the starting point, we can simply traverse the given map to print itinerary in order. The following are steps.

```
1) Create a HashMap of given pair of tickets.  Let the created
   HashMap be 'dataset'. Every entry of 'dataset' is of the form
   "from->to" like "Chennai" -> "Banglore"

2) Find the starting point of itinerary.
     a) Create a reverse HashMap.  Let the reverse be 'reverseMap'
        Entries of 'reverseMap' are of the form "to->form".
        Following is 'reverseMap' for above example.
        "Banglore"-> "Chennai"
        "Delhi"   -> "Bombay"
        "Chennai" -> "Goa"
        "Goa"     ->  "Delhi"

     b) Traverse 'dataset'.  For every key of dataset, check if it
        is there in 'reverseMap'.  If a key is not present, then we
        found the starting point. In the above example, "Bombay" is
        starting point.

3)Start from above found starting point and traverse the 'dataset'
   to print itinerary.
```

All of the above steps require O(n) time so overall time complexity is O(n).

## Code Snippets

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class UnionAndIntersection {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr1 = {7,3,9};
        int[] arr2 = {6,3,9,2,4};
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();

        // Union
        for (int i=0;i<arr1.length;i++){
            set.add(arr1[i]);
        }
        for (int i=0;i<arr2.length;i++){
            set.add(arr2[i]);
        }
        System.out.println(set.size());

        //intersection
        set.clear();
        for (int i=0;i<arr1.length;i++){
            set.add(arr1[i]);
        }
        int count=0;
        for (int i=0; i<arr2.length;i++){
            if (set.contains(arr2[i])){
                count++;
                set.remove(arr2[i]);
            }
        }
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}
```

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class ItineraryTickets { //journey(itinerary)
    public static String getStart(HashMap<String, String> tickets){
        HashMap<String, String> revMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (String key:tickets.keySet()){
            revMap.put(tickets.get(key),key);
        }
        for (String key:tickets.keySet()){
            if (!revMap.containsKey(key)){
                return key;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<String,String> tickets = new HashMap<>();
        tickets.put("Chennai","Bengaluru");
        tickets.put("Mumbai","Delhi");
        tickets.put("Goa","Chennai");
        tickets.put("Delhi","Goa");
        String start = getStart(tickets);
        System.out.print(start);
        for (String key: tickets.keySet()){
            System.out.print(" -> " + tickets.get(start));
            start = tickets.get(start);
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```
