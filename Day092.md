## Key Concepts

## Saving Drawings as Images in Doodle It App

## **Overview**

In this documentation, we will discuss the process of implementing the feature to save drawings as images in the Doodle It App. This feature allows users to save their created drawings to their device's local storage.

## **Step 1: Adding Save Button in activity_main.xml**

To begin with, we need to add a Save button to the main activity's layout file (activity_main.xml). This button will trigger the saving functionality. Use the following code snippet to add the Save button:

```xml
<ImageButton
    android:id="@+id/saveButton"
    android:layout_width="50dp"
    android:layout_height="50dp"
    android:src="@drawable/save_svgrepo_com" />
```

## **Step 2: Defining File Path in XML**

Next, we need to define a file path where the captured images will be stored. Create a new XML file (e.g., paths.xml) in the res/xml folder and add the following code:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<paths xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <external-path
        name="captured"
        path="Android/data/kt.harshsingh.doodleit/files" />
</paths>
```

## **Step 3: Requesting Storage Write Permission**

To write images to the device's storage, we need to request the necessary permission in the AndroidManifest.xml file. Add the following code snippet inside the **`<manifest>`** tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"
    android:maxSdkVersion="32" />
```

## **Step 4: Creating a File Provider**

To handle file access and sharing, we need to create a file provider in the AndroidManifest.xml file. Add the following code inside the **`<application>`** tag:

```xml
<provider
    android:authorities="kt.harshsingh.doodleit.fileprovider"
    android:name="androidx.core.content.FileProvider"
    android:exported="false"
    android:grantUriPermissions="true">
```

## **Step 5: Adding Metadata for Images**

To ensure compatibility with the library used, we need to add metadata for images inside the **`<activity>`** tag in the AndroidManifest.xml file. Use the following code:

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="android.app.lib_name"
    android:value="" />
```

## **Step 6: Implementing getBitmapFromView Function**

In this step, we will implement the **`getBitmapFromView`** function in the MainActivity.kt file. This function is responsible for converting a view, in this case, the drawing, into a bitmap that can be saved as an image.

```kotlin
private fun getBitmapFromView(view: View): Bitmap {
    val returnedBitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(view.width, view.height, Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888)
    val canvas = Canvas(returnedBitmap)
    val bgDrawable = view.background
    if (bgDrawable != null) {
        bgDrawable.draw(canvas)
    } else {
        canvas.drawColor(Color.WHITE)
    }

    view.draw(canvas)
    return returnedBitmap
}
```

Let's break down the code and explain each part:

- The **`getBitmapFromView`** function takes a **`view`** parameter, which represents the drawing view that we want to convert into a bitmap.
- First, we create a new bitmap called **`returnedBitmap`** using the **`Bitmap.createBitmap()`** method. We pass the dimensions of the view (**`view.width`** and **`view.height`**) and specify the bitmap configuration as **`Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888`**, which supports transparency.
- We create a **`Canvas`** object using the **`returnedBitmap`**. The **`Canvas`** class provides methods for drawing on a bitmap.
- Next, we check if the view has a background drawable (**`view.background`**). If it does, we draw the background drawable onto the canvas using the **`draw()`** method of the **`Drawable`** object.
- If the view doesn't have a background drawable, we fill the canvas with a white color using the **`drawColor()`** method of the **`Canvas`** object.
- Finally, we draw the view itself onto the canvas using the **`draw()`** method of the **`View`** object.
- The resulting bitmap, **`returnedBitmap`**, now contains the drawing captured from the view.
- We return the **`returnedBitmap`** from the function.

By calling this **`getBitmapFromView`** function and passing the drawing view as an argument, you can obtain a bitmap representation of the drawing. This bitmap can then be used to save the drawing as an image in the local storage of the device.
