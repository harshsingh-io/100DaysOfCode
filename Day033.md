## Key Concepts

The Longest Common Substring problem can be solved using the Longest Common Subsequence approach by modifying the LCS tabulation method. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Create a table of size (n+1) x (m+1), where n and m are the lengths of the two strings.
2. Initialize the first row and first column of the table to 0.
3. Traverse through the table and fill it according to the following rule:
    - If the characters in the two strings match at a particular position (i, j), then the value in the cell (i, j) should be the value in the cell (i-1, j-1) plus 1.
    - If the characters in the two strings do not match at a particular position (i, j), then the value in the cell (i, j) should be 0.
4. During the traversal, keep track of the maximum value in the table and its corresponding cell. This cell will give the ending index of the longest common substring.
5. Once the table is filled, use the ending index and the maximum value to extract the longest common substring.


**More detailed explanation of the steps in the algorithm if you don’t know Longest Common Subsequences :**

1. The **`longest_common_substring`** function takes two strings **`s1`** and **`s2`** as input.
2. The lengths of the two strings are stored in variables **`n`** and **`m`**, respectively.
3. A table of size **`(n+1) x (m+1)`** is created using the **`array`** function. This table will be used to store the lengths of common substrings.
4. Variables **`max_len`** and **`max_index`** are initialized to 0 and **`(0,0)`**, respectively. These variables will be used to keep track of the longest common substring and its ending index.
5. Two nested loops are used to traverse through the table. The loops run from 0 to **`n`** and 0 to **`m`**, respectively.
6. At each cell **`(i,j)`** in the table, the following conditions are checked:
    
    a. If either **`i`** or **`j`** is 0, then the value in the cell should be 0. This is because there cannot be any common substrings between an empty string and a non-empty string.
    
    b. If the characters in **`s1`** and **`s2`** at positions **`i-1`** and **`j-1`**, respectively, are the same, then the value in the cell **`(i,j)`** should be equal to the value in the cell **`(i-1,j-1)`** plus 1. This is because the current characters match, so we can extend a common substring by one character.
    
    c. If the characters in **`s1`** and **`s2`** at positions **`i-1`** and **`j-1`**, respectively, are not the same, then the value in the cell **`(i,j)`** should be 0. This is because we cannot extend a common substring if the current characters do not match.
    
7. If the value in the current cell **`(i,j)`** is greater than **`max_len`**, then we update **`max_len`** and **`max_index`** to store the length of the longest common substring and its ending index, respectively.
8. Once the table is filled, the longest common substring can be extracted by starting at the cell **`(i,j)`** stored in **`max_index`** and following a diagonal path of cells with non-zero values. The characters at the corresponding positions in **`s1`** form the longest common substring.
9. The function returns the longest common substring.

```java
public static int lcsTab(String str1, String str2) {
        int n = str1.length();
        int m = str2.length();
        int dp[][] = new int[n + 1][m + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m + 1; j++) {
                if (i == 0 || j == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < m + 1; j++) {
                if (str1.charAt(i - 1) == str2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                } else {
                    int ans1 = dp[i - 1][j];
                    int ans2 = dp[i][j - 1];
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(ans1, ans2);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][m];
    }
```

```java
public class LongestCommonSubstring {
    public static int LCSubstring(String str1, String str2) {
        int ans =0;
        int n = str1.length();
        int m = str2.length();
        int dp[][] = new int[n + 1][m + 1];
        //initialization
        for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
            dp[i][0]=0;
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < m + 1; j++) {
            dp[0][j]=0;
        }
        //bottom up
        for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < m + 1; j++) {
                if (str1.charAt(i - 1) == str2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                    ans=Math.max(ans,dp[i][j]);
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str1 = "abcdge";
        String str2 = "abedg";
        System.out.println(LCSubstring(str1,str2));
    }
}
