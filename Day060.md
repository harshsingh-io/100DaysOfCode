## Key Concepts

## 

## **Problem Statement:**

The problem is to find the first non-repeating character in a stream of characters. This means that as characters are processed one by one, we need to identify the first character that occurs only once in the stream.

## **Examples:**

Input: "aabccxb"
Output: "a -1 b b b x"

Explanation:

- 'a' is the first character and it occurs only once, so the output is 'a'.
- 'a' occurs again, so the output is '-1' (indicating no non-repeating character so far).
- 'b' is the next character and it occurs only once, so the output is 'b'.
- 'c' occurs twice, so the output is 'b'.
- 'c' occurs again, so the output is 'b'.
- 'x' occurs once, so the output is 'x'.

## **Explanation:**

1. The code initializes an array **`freq`** of size 26 to store the frequencies of characters from 'a' to 'z'. It also creates a queue **`q`** to maintain the order of characters in the stream.
2. For each character in the input string, the code performs the following steps:
    - Adds the character to the queue.
    - Increments the frequency of the character in the **`freq`** array.
    - Checks if the first character in the queue has a frequency greater than 1. If it does, the character is removed from the queue.
    - If the queue is empty, it means there are no non-repeating characters so far, and -1 is printed.
    - Otherwise, the first character in the queue is printed as it is the first non-repeating character.
3. The process continues until all characters in the input string are processed.

## **Approach:**

The code uses a queue to maintain the order of characters in the stream and an array to keep track of their frequencies. As each character is processed, it is added to the queue and its frequency is incremented. If a character's frequency becomes greater than 1, it is removed from the queue. The first character in the queue at any given point represents the first non-repeating character.

## **Pseudocode:**

```
perlCopy code
printNonRepeating(string):
    freq = array of size 26 initialized with all 0s
    q = empty queue

    for i = 0 to length of string:
        ch = character at index i in string
        add ch to q
        increment freq[ch - 'a']

        while q is not empty and freq[front of q - 'a'] > 1:
            remove front of q

        if q is empty:
            print -1
        else:
            print front of q

    print newline
```

## **Dry Run:**

Let's perform a dry run of the provided example "aabccxb" using the given code.

Initial state:

- freq: [0, 0, ..., 0] (26 zeros)
- q: []
1. Process 'a':
    - freq: [1, 0, ..., 0] (frequency of 'a' becomes 1)
    - q: ['a']
    - Print 'a'
2. Process 'a':
    - freq: [2, 0, ..., 0] (frequency of 'a' becomes 2)
    - q: ['a', 'a']
    - Print -1
3. Process 'b':
    - freq: [2, 0, 1, 0, ..., 0] (frequency of 'b' becomes 1)
    - q: ['a', 'a', 'b']
    - Print 'b'
4. Process 'c':
    - freq: [2, 0, 1, 1, ..., 0] (frequency of 'c' becomes 1)
    - q: ['a', 'a', 'b', 'c']
    - Print 'b'
5. Process 'c':
    - freq: [2, 0, 1, 2, ..., 0] (frequency of 'c' becomes 2)
    - q: ['a', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'c']
    - Print 'b'
6. Process 'x':
    - freq: [2, 0, 1, 2, ..., 0] (frequency of 'x' becomes 1)
    - q: ['a', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'x']
    - Print 'x'

The final output is "a -1 b b b x".

## Code Snippets

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class FirstNonRepeatingCharacter {
    public static void printNonRepeating(String str){
        int[] freq = new int[26]; // 'a' to 'z'
        Queue<Character> q = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i=0;i<str.length();i++){
            char ch = str.charAt(i);
            q.add(ch);
            freq[ch-'a']++;
            while (!q.isEmpty() && freq[q.peek()-'a']>1){
                q.remove();
            }
            if (q.isEmpty()){
                System.out.print(-1+" ");
            } else {
                System.out.print(q.peek()+" ");
            }
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "aabccxb";
        printNonRepeating(str);
    }
}
```
