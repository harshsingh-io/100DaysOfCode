# Coroutines in Kotlin - Asynchronous Programming Made Easy

# **Introduction**

As we all know by default all the components in an Android application use the same thread of execution which is nothing but our **Main Thread**. As the application was single-threaded this main thread has many duties to perform like drawing the views, executing logical pieces of code in a sequential manner, etc. So it was our responsibility to make sure that we are not blocking the main thread. To do this we need a **multi-threaded** approach in some cases like performing network operations, heavy logical operations, etc. As these long or short running tasks take time we shouldn’t hold the main thread until they are completed because it freezes the app making it unresponsive.

## **Problem**

Multithreading in Android has always been a challenge because of the callback mechanism. It has been a challenge because switching threads and resuming tasks is not so easy. It started with Async task then Rx Java and now Coroutines.

In this post lets explore how to do multithreading in a simpler way using Kotlin Coroutines. Let’s explore most of the stuff related to Coroutines. If you directly want to check the code base go through [android_coroutine_sample](https://github.com/pavan5208/android_coroutine_sample)

# **What is a Coroutine?**

From [Kotlin docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/coroutines/coroutines-basic-jvm.html#:~:text=Kotlin%201.1%20introduced%20coroutines%2C%20a,wrappers%20for%20existing%20Java%20libraries.):

> One can think of a coroutine as a light-weight thread. Like threads, coroutines can run in parallel, wait for each other and communicate. The biggest difference is that coroutines are very cheap, almost free: we can create thousands of them, and pay very little in terms of performance. True threads, on the other hand, are expensive to start and keep around. A thousand threads can be a serious challenge for a modern machine.
> 

So we can say coroutines are nothing but **lightweight threads**. Coroutines provide us an easy way to do **synchronous** and **asynchronous** programming. Coroutines allow execution to be **suspended** and **resumed** later at some point in the future which is best suited for performing non-blocking operations in the case of multithreading.

A coroutine is an instance of suspendable computation. The main advantages of using Coroutines

- They are **light-weight**
- Built-in **cancellation** support
- Lower chances for **memory leaks**
- **Jetpack** libraries provide coroutines support

Coroutines were added to Kotlin in version 1.1. We need to add the following dependency of **kotlinx.coroutines** to the module-level build Gradle file to access coroutines.

```
implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-android:$kotlin_version"
```

Before going through the creation and usage let’s get familiar with some important concepts related to coroutines

1. suspend
2. Job
3. Dispatchers
4. CoroutineScope
5. CoroutineContext

# **suspend**

**suspend** is nothing but a keyword. A **suspend function** is nothing but a function that can be **paused** and **resumed** at some later point in time. We can execute long-running operations and wait for them to complete without blocking. The syntax of a suspending function is the same as the regular **function** but has an addition of the **suspend** keyword.

```
suspend fun sample() {
}
```

> Note: One important thumb rule is Suspend function should be called only from a coroutine or another suspend function
> 

Let’s take an example and understand better. Let’s create an Activity with two suspend functions with some delay and inside OnCreate let’s execute some logic to check how the suspend functions work. Have a look at the below code where GlobalScope.launch creates and launches a coroutine because suspend functions can’t be called directly in normal functions.

In the below code **delay** is nothing but another suspend function that Delays coroutine for a given time **without blocking** a thread and **resumes** it after a specified time.

Without further scrolling below the code snippet by applying the above theoretical knowledge guess the output from the code like **the sequence of print statement executed**

## **Output**

```
13:49:30.966 /System.out:EOF
13:49:30.967 /System.out:sampleOne1624781970967
13:49:31.971 /System.out:sampleTwo1624781971971
13:49:32.975 System.out: The answer is 20
13:49:32.976 System.out:Completed in 2008 ms
```

So we can observe that the last statement of the **OnCreate** is called first as there was a delay in functions **sampleOne** and **sampleTwo** which are executed sequentially.

So finally what we can understand is that suspend functions suspends the execution until the task is finished and resumes back once completed.

# **Job**

A **Job** is a handle to a coroutine. A job is a **cancellable** thing with a **life cycle** that ends on its completion or cancellation or failure.

From [Kotlin Docs](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-job/index.html)

> Jobs can be arranged into parent-child hierarchies where the cancellation of a parent leads to the immediate cancellation of all its children recursively. Failure of a child with an exception other than CancellationException immediately cancels its parent and, consequently, all its other children.
> 

Each coroutine that we create with `launch` or `async` returns a `Job` object that uniquely identifies the coroutine and manages its lifecycle. If we use a normal Job instance when there was an exception in any child other than CancellationException it cancels the parent as well as other children. To overcome this scenario we have a **SupervisorJob.**

```
private val superJob =lazy{SupervisorJob()}
private val job =lazy{Job()}
```

While creating an instance of SupervisorJob we even can provide a parent Job as an argument depending on our requirement*.* Children of a supervisor job can fail independently of each other. A failure or cancellation of any child does not cause the supervisor job to fail and does not affect its other children, so a supervisor can implement a custom logic for handling failures of its children.

We can also pass a `Job` to a `CoroutineScope` to manage its lifecycle

```
class SampleClass {fun sampleMethod() {
        // Handle to the coroutine, we can control its lifecycle
valjob = scope.launch(Dispatchers.IO) {}

        if (true) {
            job.cancel()
        }
    }
}
```

The statement **`job.cancel()`** just cancels the coroutine started above, this doesn’t affect the scope.

> A job is in the active state while the coroutine is working or until the job is completed, or until it fails or canceled.
> 

# **Dispatchers**

Dispatchers specify on which thread the operation should be performed. Dispatchers are nothing but schedulers in Rx. In Android, we mainly have three dispatchers

**Dispatchers.Main:** A coroutine dispatcher that is confined to the **Main thread** operating with UI objects. This dispatcher can be used either directly or via the MainScope factory. Usually, such dispatcher is single-threaded.

Access to this property may throw **IllegalStateException** if no main thread dispatchers are present in the classpath.

**Dispatchers.Default:** The default CoroutineDispatcher that is used by all coroutine builders like launch, async, etc if no dispatcher nor any other ContinuationInterceptor is specified in their context. It is Optimized for CPU intensive work off the main thread

**Dispatchers.IO:** The CoroutineDispatcher is designed for offloading blocking IO tasks to a shared pool of threads and networking operations. Additional threads in this pool are created and are shut down on demand.

# **withContext**

Inside a coroutine, we use **`withContext`** to switch between Dispatchers. It’s nothing but a suspend function. It calls the specified suspending block with a given coroutine context, suspends until it completes, and returns the result. This suspending function is cancellable. It immediately checks for cancellation of the resulting context and throws **CancellationException** if it is not active

```
withContext(Dispatchers.Main)
```

# **Coroutine Scope**

A `CoroutineScope` keeps **track** of any coroutine it creates using the builder functions`launch` or `async`. It provides the ability to **cancel** a coroutine at any point in time. The scope is nothing but a lifespan. A coroutine cannot be launched without scope. `CoroutineScope` gets notified whenever a **failure** happens.

In Android, we have KTX libraries that provide a `CoroutineScope` in relation to lifecycle classes such as **`viewModelScope`** and **`lifecycleScope`**. We need to add **lifecycle-viewmodel-ktx** dependency to the module-level build.gradle to access these custom scopes

```
implementation  'androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel-ktx:2.3.1'
```

Let’s check the below code how to create the scope and launch coroutine and cancel when the component is destroying

Basically, CoroutineScope takes **CoroutineContext** as an argument. Check out the inbuilt code in package kotlinx.coroutines

```
public fun CoroutineScope(context: CoroutineContext): CoroutineScope =
    ContextScope(if (context[Job] != null) context else context +Job())
```

Job is an optional parameter while creating coroutine Scope. If the given context does not contain a Job element, then a default `Job()` is created.

# **CoroutineContext**

CoroutineContext is nothing but an interface added in Kotlin 1.3. The persistent context for the coroutine. It is an indexed set of Element instances.

An indexed set is a mix between a set and a map. Every element in this set has a unique

From [Developer Docs](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines/coroutines-adv):

A CoroutineContext defines the behavior of a coroutine using the following set of elements:

- `Job`: Controls the lifecycle of the coroutine.
- `CoroutineDispatcher`: Dispatches work to the appropriate thread.
- `CoroutineName`: The name of the coroutine, useful for debugging.
- `CoroutineExceptionHandler`: Handles uncaught exceptions.

# **Creation of Coroutines using Coroutine builders**

Coroutine builders are simple extension functions that can create and start a coroutine. They act as a bridge between the normal world and the suspending world as suspending functions can’t be accessed from the normal world. As Builders are not of type suspend so they can be accessed even in normal functions

Creating a coroutine is very simple. Let’s check how to do that using these builders

1. **launch**
2. **async**
3. **runBlocking**

## **launch**

The simplest way to create a coroutine is by calling the **launch** builder on a specified scope**.** It ****Launches a new coroutine without blocking the current thread and returns a reference to the coroutine as a Job. The coroutine is canceled when the resulting job is canceled. The launch doesn’t return any result. It is used in scenarios of “**fire and forget**” where we launched the work on a new thread but not bothered about the result.

```
scope.launch(Dispatchers.IO){
 //New Coroutine is created
  uploadLogData()
}
```

## **async**

With the async builder, we can start a new coroutine and it **returns a result** with a suspend function call **`await`**. The return type of async is **deffered** which similar to future in Java or promise in JavaScript. We can’t use **async** in a normal function as it has to call suspend function **await** to get the result. So we generally use **launch** builder inside a normal function and then use **async** inside it. We need to generally use `async` only when we need the parallel execution of different tasks as it waits for all the tasks to be completed and returns a deferred result

A simple example to illustrate async

```
suspend fun getUser(): User = viewModelScope{
val result =async(Dispatchers.IO){
fetchUserData()
}
    result.await()
}
```

**async** creates a coroutine and returns its future result as an implementation of Deferred. The result is of type Deferred<T> where T is our type required

Guess the sequence of statements printed with the below code

**Output**

```
19:05:58 /System.out: First statement of Async
19:05:58 /System.out: Last statement of Async
19:06:01 /System.out: Someone returned false
```

If you check the output the last statement took only 3 seconds which is nothing but time taken to get the result from the second method. So it will perform parallel execution of tasks, not one after the other and waits for all the tasks to be completed. The final completion time would be the time taken by a heavier task to be completed.

## **runBlocking**

runBlocking blocks the current thread on which it is invoked until the coroutine is completed. It runs the coroutine in the context on the thread it is invoked.

It throws **InterruptedException** If the blocked thread is interrupted. Let’s check a code snippet with ***runBlocking***

```
fun sampleRunBlocking(){
println("First statement of runBlocking")
runBlocking{
delay(3000L)
println("Middle  statement of runBlocking")
}
println("Last statement of runBlocking")
}
```

The output is simple here as `runBlocking` blocks the thread and doesn’t allow the next statements to be executed. The statements would be printed sequentially

## **Output**

```
19:19:24 I/System.out: First statement of runBlocking
19:19:27 I/System.out: Middle  statement of runBlocking
19:19:27 I/System.out: Last statement of runBlocking
```

# **Exception Handling in Kotlin Coroutines**

We need to take care of exceptions and handle them with **try/catch** or by providing **CoroutineExceptionHandler.**

In the case of using **launch** coroutine builder, the exception will be thrown immediately. So it would be best to wrap it with try/catch

```
scope.launch {
    try {
        doSomething()
    } catch(e: Exception) {
        // Handle exception logic
    }
}
```

However, in the case of **async,** it’s not the case. It holds the exception until **await** is invoked. So we can wrap the `.await()` call inside `try/catch`

```
viewModelScope{
val deferredResult =async{
doSomething()
}
try {
        deferredResult.await()
    } catch(e: Exception) {
        // Handle exception thrown
    }
}
```

The `CoroutineExceptionHandler` is another optional parameter of a `CoroutineContext` allowing us to handle uncaught exceptions**.** We need to define the handler and pass it to the coroutine scope

```
val handler =CoroutineExceptionHandler{context, exception->
Log.d(TAG, "$exception thrown")
}
```

The simple usage will be

```
scope.launch(handler) {
    launch{
throw Exception("Sample Exception thrown")
}
}
```

# **Summary**

Kotlin coroutines made multi-threading super easy. But it is equally important to know all the concepts while dealing with coroutines. Scopes and jobs would help to control and deal with cancellations of coroutines. Use coroutine builders to easily create coroutines. Writing asynchronous code was made easy using suspend functions and coroutine builders.
