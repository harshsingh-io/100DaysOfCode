## Key Concepts

### Trapping Rain Water(Brute Force)

**Problem Description:**

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute the maximum amount of water that can be trapped.

**Approach:**

We can use a brute force approach to solve this problem by considering every possible pair of bars and calculating the water trapped between them. We can then return the maximum of all these values.

**Pseudocode:**

```
storeWater(height):
    maxWater = 0
    for i = 0 to height.size() - 1:
        for j = i + 1 to height.size() - 1:
            width = j - i
            ht = min(height.get(i), height.get(j))
            currWater = ht * width
            maxWater = max(maxWater, currWater)
    return maxWater
```

**Code Explanation:**

- The **`storeWater`** function takes an ArrayList of heights as input and returns the maximum amount of water that can be trapped.
- We initialize **`maxWater`** to 0, which will be updated with the maximum value of water that can be trapped.
- We use two nested loops to consider every possible pair of bars. The outer loop iterates over the starting bar and the inner loop iterates over the ending bar.
- For each pair of bars, we calculate the width as the difference between their indices and the height as the minimum of their heights.
- We then calculate the water trapped as the product of width and height and update **`maxWater`** with the maximum of its current value and **`currWater`**.
- Finally, we return the **`maxWater`**.

**Key Points:**

- This brute force approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) since we are considering every possible pair of bars.
- There are more efficient algorithms such as the two-pointer approach with a time complexity of O(n) which is an optimal solution for this problem.
- The given code follows the brute force approach and computes the correct answer for the given input values.

**Dry Run:**

Let's dry run the code on the given input values:

```
height = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]
```

- The outer loop starts at index 0, which corresponds to height 1.
    - The inner loop starts at index 1, which corresponds to height 8.
        - The width is 1 since the bars are adjacent.
        - The height is 1 since 1 is smaller than 8.
        - The trapped water is 1.
        - **`maxWater`** is updated to 1.
    - The inner loop continues to consider the remaining bars and updates **`maxWater`** as necessary.
- The outer loop continues to consider the remaining bars.
- The final value of **`maxWater`** is returned as 49, which is the correct answer for the given input values.

## Code Snippets

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class MostWater {
    public static int storeWater(ArrayList<Integer> height){
//        BruteForce Approach
        int maxWater = 0;
        for (int i=0;i<height.size();i++){
            for (int j=i+1;j<height.size();j++){
                int width = j-i;
                int ht = Math.min(height.get(i), height.get(j));
                int currWater = ht*width;
                maxWater = Math.max(maxWater, currWater);
            }
        }
        return maxWater;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<Integer> height = new ArrayList<>();
        //1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7
        height.add(1);
        height.add(8);
        height.add(6);
        height.add(2);
        height.add(5);
        height.add(4);
        height.add(8);
        height.add(3);
        height.add(7);
        System.out.println(storeWater(height));

    }
}
```
