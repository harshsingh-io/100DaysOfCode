## Key Concepts

**Problem Description:**

The problem is to determine whether a given singly linked list is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., "racecar".

**Approach:**

The approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:

1. Find the middle node of the linked list using the slow and fast pointer technique.
2. Reverse the second half of the linked list.
3. Compare the left half of the linked list with the reversed right half of the linked list to check if the linked list is a palindrome.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function findMidSF(head)
    slow = head
    fast = head
    while fast != null && fast.next != null
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    return slow

function checkPalindrome()
    if head == null || head.next == null
        return true
    midNode = findMidSF(head)
    prev = null
    curr = midNode
    while curr != null
        next = curr.next
        curr.next = prev
        prev = curr
        curr = next
    right = prev
    left = head
    while right != null
        if left.data != right.data
            return false
        left = left.next
        right = right.next
    return true
```

**Code Explanation:**

The given code defines two functions: **`findMidSF`** and **`checkPalindrome`**. The **`findMidSF`** function is used to find the middle node of the linked list using the slow and fast pointer technique. The **`checkPalindrome`** function is used to check whether the linked list is a palindrome or not.

The **`checkPalindrome`** function first checks whether the linked list is empty or contains only one element. If this is the case, the function returns true as a single element is always a palindrome. Next, it calls the **`findMidSF`** function to find the middle node of the linked list. It then reverses the second half of the linked list by iterating from the middle node to the end of the list. Finally, it compares the left half of the linked list with the reversed right half of the linked list to check if the linked list is a palindrome. If the linked list is a palindrome, the function returns true, otherwise, it returns false.

**Dry Run:**

Let's dry run the code with an example linked list: **`1->2->3->2->1`**

- The **`findMidSF`** function will return the middle node, which is **`3`**.
- The second half of the linked list will be reversed, resulting in the list **`1->2->3<-2<-1`**.
- The **`checkPalindrome`** function will compare the left half of the linked list, which is **`1->2->3`**, with the reversed right half of the linked list, which is **`1->2->3`**. Since both halves are equal, the function will return true.

**Complexity Analysis:**

- Time Complexity: The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. Finding the middle node takes O(n/2) time and reversing the second half of the linked list takes O(n/2) time. The comparison of the left and right halves of the linked list also takes O(n/2) time. Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n/2) + O(n/2) + O(n/2) = O(n).
- Space Complexity: The space complexity of the solution is O(1), as the only extra space used is for the pointers.

### Doubly Linked List in Java

Introduction:

- Doubly Linked List is a linear data structure where each node contains a reference to the next and previous node.
- It differs from the singly linked list by having a pointer to the previous node as well as the next node.

Implementation:

- We create a static inner class Node with data, next and prev as its fields.
- We define head, tail, and size as static fields for the LinkedList class.

Methods:

- addFirst(int data) - adds a new node to the beginning of the list.
    - Create a new node with the given data.
    - Increment the size of the list.
    - If the list is empty, set both head and tail to the new node.
    - Otherwise, set the new node as the head of the list and update the previous pointer of the previous head node.
- addLast(int data) - adds a new node to the end of the list.
    - Create a new node with the given data.
    - If the list is empty, set both head and tail to the new node.
    - Otherwise, traverse the list until the last node is found and set the new node as its next node.
- removeFirst() - removes the first node from the list.
    - If the list is empty, print an error message and return Integer.MIN_VALUE.
    - If the size of the list is 1, set both head and tail to null and return the value of the only node.
    - Otherwise, remove the head node, set its next node as the new head, and update the previous pointer of the new head.
- removeLast() - removes the last node from the list.
    - If the list is empty, print an error message and return Integer.MIN_VALUE.
    - If the size of the list is 1, set both head and tail to null and return the value of the only node.
    - Otherwise, remove the tail node, set its previous node as the new tail, and update the next pointer of the new tail.

Complexity Analysis:

- Time complexity of addFirst, addLast, removeFirst, and removeLast methods is O(1) as they involve constant time operations.
- Space complexity is O(n) as we are using n nodes to store the data.

### Implement the reverse and print operation for a doubly linkedlist.

**Approach:**

- For printing, start from the head and traverse the linkedlist until the end while printing the node values.
- For reversing, start from the head and traverse the linkedlist while reversing the next and prev pointers of each node and updating the prev and curr pointers.

**Pseudocode:**

- **Print:**
    - Initialize a temporary node to the head of the linkedlist.
    - Print "null<->" as the start of the linkedlist representation.
    - Traverse the linkedlist using the temporary node until the end:
        - Print the current node's data.
        - Update the temporary node to the next node.
    - Print "null" as the end of the linkedlist representation.
- **Reverse:**
    - Initialize the current node to the head of the linkedlist, and previous and next nodes to null.
    - Traverse the linkedlist using the current node until the end:
        - Set the next node to the current node's next node.
        - Reverse the current node's next and prev pointers.
        - Update the previous node to the current node.
        - Update the current node to the next node.
    - Set the head of the linkedlist to the previous node.

**Code explanation:**

- For the print operation, the linkedlist is traversed using a temporary node starting from the head until the end while printing the data of each node in the format "null<->data<->null".
- For the reverse operation, the linkedlist is traversed using the current node starting from the head until the end while reversing the next and prev pointers of each node and updating the prev and curr pointers. Finally, the head of the linkedlist is updated to the previous node.

**Dry run:**
Suppose we have a doubly linkedlist with the values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Here's how the print and reverse operations would work:

- Print: The linkedlist representation would be "null<->1<->2<->3<->4<->5<->null".
- Reverse: After the operation, the linkedlist would be [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] with the head pointing to node 5 and the tail pointing to node 1.

Time and space complexity analysis:

- Print: The time complexity is O(n) since the linkedlist is traversed once, and the space complexity is O(1) since we only need temporary variables to traverse the linkedlist.
- Reverse: The time complexity is O(n) since the linkedlist is traversed once, and the space complexity is O(1) since we only need temporary variables to traverse and update the linkedlist.
