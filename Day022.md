## Key Concepts

### Worst Time Complexity of HashMap

In the worst-case scenario, all the keys being hashed could collide, resulting in all the elements being stored in the same bucket. In this case, the HashMap would essentially degenerate into a linked list, and the time complexity of operations could become O(n), where n is the number of elements in the map.

To prevent such worst-case scenarios, most HashMap implementations use techniques such as resizing the table and rehashing the keys to ensure that the number of collisions is minimized. Therefore, in practice, the worst-case time complexity of a HashMap is rarely encountered.

### LinkedHashMap

A LinkedHashMap is a type of HashMap in which the order of elements is maintained. It is implemented as a hash table with an additional linked list(Doubly LinkedList) that keeps track of the insertion order of elements.

In a LinkedHashMap, the order of elements is not determined by their hash code, but rather by the order in which they were inserted. This makes it different from a regular HashMap, which does not maintain any specific order of elements.

### TreeMap

TreeMap is a data structure in Java that implements the Map interface and stores its elements in a sorted order based on the keys. It uses a Red-Black Tree internally to maintain the sorted order, which ensures that the operations on the map have a time complexity of O(log n) in the worst case.

In a TreeMap, the keys must implement the Comparable interface, or a Comparator can be provided to define the ordering of keys. The TreeMap maintains the elements in a sorted order based on the ordering defined by the keys.

The worst-case time complexities for some common operations:

1. Insertion: O(log n) - Inserts a key-value pair into the TreeMap in a sorted order based on the keys. The Red-Black tree structure used internally ensures that insertion has a worst-case time complexity of O(log n).
2. Deletion: O(log n) - Removes a key-value pair from the TreeMap. The Red-Black tree structure used internally ensures that deletion has a worst-case time complexity of O(log n).
3. Search: O(log n) - Finds the value associated with a given key in the TreeMap. The Red-Black tree structure used internally ensures that search has a worst-case time complexity of O(log n).
4. Iteration: O(n) - Iterates over all the elements in the TreeMap in sorted order based on the keys. Since all elements need to be visited once, iteration has a worst-case time complexity of O(n).

### Comparison Table:

| Property | HashMap | LinkedHashMap | TreeMap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Time Complexity |  |  |  |
| Get | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) |
| Put | O(1) | O(1) | O(log n) |
| ContainsKey | O(1) | O(1) | O(log n) |
| Remove | O(1) | O(1) | O(log n) |
| Iteration Order | Random order | Sorted according to either Insertion Order or Access Order (as specified during construction) | Sorted according to either natural Order of keys or Comparator (as specified during construction) |
| Null Keys | Allowed | Allowed | Not allowed if keys use natural Ordering or Comparator does not support comparison on null Keys |
| Interface | Map | Map | Map, SortedMap and NavigableMap |
| Synchronization | None, use Collections.synchronizedMap() | None, use Collections.synchronizedMap() | None, use Collections.synchronizedMap() |
| Data Structure | List of buckets, switch to balanced tree if more than 8 entries in a bucket | Doubly linked list of buckets | Red-Black implementation of Binary Tree |
| Applications | General purpose, fast retrieval, non-synchronized. ConcurrentHashMap can be used where concurrency is involved | Can be used for LRU cache, other places where insertion or access order matters | Algorithms where Sorted or Navigable features are required. For example, find among the list of employees whose salary is next to a given employee, Range Search, etc. |
| Requirements for Keys | equals() and hashCode() need to be overwritten | equals() and hashCode() need to be overwritten | Comparator needs to be supplied for key implementation, otherwise natural order will be used to sort the keys. |

## Code Snippets

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.LinkedHashMap;
import java.util.TreeMap;

public class LinkedHashMapB {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LinkedHashMap<String, Integer> lhm = new LinkedHashMap<>();
        lhm.put("India", 100);
        lhm.put("China", 150);
        lhm.put("US", 50);
        System.out.println(lhm);

        HashMap<String, Integer> hm = new HashMap<>();
        hm.put("India", 100);
        hm.put("China", 150);
        hm.put("US", 50);
        System.out.println(hm); // different order in hashmap

        TreeMap<String, Integer> tm = new TreeMap<>();
        tm.put("India", 100);
        tm.put("China", 150);
        tm.put("US", 50);
        System.out.println(tm); //printed in sorted form basis of KEY 
    }
}
```
