## Key Concepts

# Articulation Point in Graph

**Problem Statement:** Given an undirected connected graph with V vertices and adjacency list adj. You are required to find all the vertices removing which (and edges through it) disconnect the graph into 2 or more components.

Note: Indexing is zero-based i.e nodes numbering from (0 to V-1). There might be loops present in the graph.

**Example 1**:

```
Input Format:Result: {0, 2}
Explanation: If we remove node 0 or node 2, the graph will be divided into 2 or more components.

```

**Example 2**:

```
Input Format:Result: {1, 4}
Explanation: If we remove either node 1 or node 4, the graph breaks into multiple components.
```

****Solution****

Before moving on to the solution, we need to understand the definition of the articulation point of a graph.

### **Articulation Point:**

Articulation Points of a graph are the nodes on whose removal, the graph breaks into multiple components.

Example:

![https://takeuforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-26-173547.png](https://takeuforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-26-173547.png)

For the above graph node 0 and node, 2 are the articulation points. If we remove either of the two nodes, the graph breaks into multiple components like the following:

![https://takeuforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-26-173636.png](https://takeuforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-26-173636.png)

But node 3 is not an articulation point as this node’s removal does not break the graph into multiple components.

In order to find all the articulation points of a graph, we will implement some logic over the DFS algorithm. This is more of an algorithm-based approach. So, let’s discuss the algorithm in detail. Before that, we will discuss the two important concepts of the algorithm i.e. ***time of insertion and lowest time of insertion.***

- **Time of insertion:** Dring the DFS call, the time when a node is visited, is called its time of insertion. For example, if in the above graph, we start DFS from node 0 it will visit node 1 first then node 2, node 3, and so on. So, the time of insertion for node 0 will be 1, node 1 will be 2, node 2 will be 3 and it will continue like this. ***We will use a time array to store the insertion time for each node***.This definition remains the same as it was during the bridge problem.
- **Lowest time of insertion:** In this case, the current node refers to all its adjacent nodes ***except the parent and the visited nodes*** and takes the minimum lowest time of insertion into account. To store this entity for each node, we will use another ‘***low***’ array.***The difference in finding the lowest time of insertion in this problem is that in the bridgealgorithm, we only excluded the parent node but in this algorithm, we are excluding the visited nodes along with the parent node.***

***The logical modification of the DFS algorithm is discussed below***:

To find out the bridges in the bridge problem, we checked inside the DFS, if there exists any alternative path from the adjacent node to the current node.

But here we cannot do so as in this case, we are trying to remove the current node along with all the edges linked to it. For that reason, here we will check if there exists any path from the adjacent node to the previous node of the current node. ***In addition to that***, we must ensure that the current node we are trying to remove must not be the starting node.

```
The check conditions for this case will change like the following:
if(low[it] > tin[node])  converts to if(low[it] >= tin[node] && parent  != -1)
```

For the starting node, we will apply different logic.

**The logic for the starting node:**

If the node is a starting point we will check the number of children of the node. If the starting node has more than 1 child(The children must not be connected), it will definitely be one of the articulation points.

To find the number of children, we will generally count the number of adjacent nodes. But there is a point to notice. In the following graph, the starting node 0 has two adjacent nodes, but it is not an articulation point.

![https://takeuforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-26-173858.png](https://takeuforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-26-173858.png)

To avoid this edge case, we will increment the number of children only if the adjacent node is not previously visited(*i.e. child++ will be inside the not visited if statement*).

**We can get a single node as an articulation point multiple times:**

If we carefully observe, we can easily notice that we can get a single node as the articulation point multiple times. For example, consider the following graph:

![https://takeuforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-26-173950.png](https://takeuforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-26-173950.png)

While checking for node 2, we will get the node as the articulation point once for the first component that contains nodes 4, 5, and 6 and we will again get the same node 2 for the second component that includes the nodes 7, 8, and 9.

***To avoid the storing of duplicate nodes, we will store the nodes in a hash array(i.e. mark array used in the code) instead of directly inserting them in a simple array.***

### **Approach**:

The approach involves checking three cases to identify the articulation points.

1. Case 1: Checking for bridges
Tarjan's algorithm is used to identify bridges in the graph. A bridge is an edge in the graph whose removal increases the number of connected components. By applying Tarjan's algorithm, you can determine if there are any bridges in the graph.
2. Case 2: Checking for cycles in components
Tarjan's algorithm is again used to find cycles in the connected components of the graph. If a component contains a cycle, then removing any node in that cycle will not disconnect the graph. Hence, the nodes in such components are not articulation points.
3. Case 3: Checking for the root node
If the current node is the root of the DFS traversal tree and has more than one disconnected child, then it is considered an articulation point. This case ensures that the root node is properly identified as an articulation point if necessary.

1. Create a class **`Edge`** to represent an edge in the graph. The class should have attributes for the source node, destination node, and weight of the edge.
2. Create a function **`createGraph`** to initialize the graph with the given edges. The graph is represented as an array of adjacency lists.
3. Create a function **`dfs`** that performs a depth-first search traversal on the graph.
    
    a. Initialize the **`dt`** (discovery time) and **`low`** arrays, both of size **`V`**, where **`V`** is the number of vertices in the graph. Initialize the **`vis`** array to track visited nodes and the **`articulationPoint`** array to keep track of articulation points.
    
    b. Mark the current node as visited and assign the discovery time and low values as **`++time`**.
    
    c. Iterate over the neighbors of the current node.
    
    i. If the neighbor is the parent node, skip it and continue to the next neighbor.
    
    ii. If the neighbor is not visited, recursively call the **`dfs`** function for that neighbor. Update the low value of the current node based on the low value of the neighbor.
    
    ```
      - If the discovery time of the current node is less than or equal to the low value of the neighbor and the current node is not already marked as an articulation point, mark it as an articulation point.
    
      - Increment the `children` count.
    ```
    
    iii. If the neighbor is already visited, update the low value of the current node based on the discovery time of the neighbor.
    
    d. If the current node is the root (i.e., the parent is -1) and the number of children is greater than 1, mark the current node as an articulation point.
    
4. Create a function **`getArticulationPoint`** to find the articulation points in the graph.
    
    a. Initialize the **`dt`**, **`low`**, **`vis`**, and **`articulationPoint`** arrays.
    
    b. Iterate over all the nodes in the graph.
    
    i. If a node is not visited, call the **`dfs`** function for that node.
    
    c. Print the nodes that are marked as articulation points.
    
5. In the **`main`** function:
    
    a. Set the number of vertices (**`V`**) and create an array of adjacency lists representing the graph.
    
    b. Call the **`createGraph`** function to initialize the graph.
    
    c. Call the **`getArticulationPoint`** function to find and print the articulation points in the graph.
    

**Time Complexity:** O(V+2E), where V = no. of vertices, E = no. of edges. It is because the algorithm is just a simple DFS traversal.

**Space Complexity:** O(3V), where V = no. of vertices. O(3V) is for the three arrays i.e. tin, low, and vis, each of size V.
