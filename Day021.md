## Key Concepts

I recommend you to look a tutorial for better understanding because documentation won't help that much in this. You have look a tutorial video for understanding internal working of HashMap. Still I'll try to elaborate the points I learned while implementing HashMap

### put() Function Implementation

The **`put`** function implementation of a HashMap is responsible for adding or updating a key-value pair in the HashMap. Here's a high-level overview of the **`put`** function implementation:

1. Calculate the hash code of the key. This is done using the **`hashCode()`** method of the key object. The hash code is used to determine the index in the array where the key-value pair will be stored.
2. Convert the hash code to an index. This is done by performing a bitwise operation on the hash code to ensure it falls within the range of indices in the underlying array. The index is then used to access the appropriate bucket in the array.
3. If the bucket is empty, create a new node with the key-value pair and add it to the bucket. If the bucket is not empty, iterate through the nodes in the bucket to find the node with the matching key.
4. If a node with the matching key is found, update its value with the new value. If no node with the matching key is found, create a new node with the key-value pair and add it to the bucket.
5. If the number of elements in the HashMap exceeds a certain threshold (called the load factor), the HashMap will be resized to prevent performance degradation. This involves creating a new, larger array and rehashing all the elements in the existing array into the new array.

The implementation of the **`put`** function in a HashMap can vary depending on the specific implementation details, but these are the basic steps involved in adding or updating a key-value pair in a HashMap.

### rehash() Function Implementation

The **`rehash`** function implementation of a HashMap is responsible for increasing the size of the underlying array and reorganizing the key-value pairs in the HashMap to ensure that they are still stored in the correct buckets. Here's a high-level overview of the **`rehash`** function implementation:

1. Create a new array with a larger capacity than the existing array. The new capacity is typically a multiple of the current capacity, such as twice the current capacity.
2. Iterate through each bucket in the existing array and rehash each key-value pair into the new array. This involves recalculating the hash code of the key and determining the appropriate bucket in the new array where the key-value pair should be stored.
3. Store each key-value pair in its new bucket in the new array.
4. Once all key-value pairs have been rehashed into the new array, replace the existing array with the new array.

The purpose of the **`rehash`** function is to prevent the HashMap from becoming too full, which can lead to performance degradation as the number of collisions (when multiple keys are mapped to the same bucket) increases. By increasing the size of the underlying array and rehashing the key-value pairs, the HashMap can maintain a relatively low load factor and continue to perform efficiently.

### containsKey(K key) Function

The **`containsKey(K key)`** function implementation of a HashMap is responsible for checking whether the HashMap contains a mapping for the specified key. Here's a high-level overview of the **`containsKey(K key)`** function implementation:

1. Calculate the hash code of the key using the **`hashCode()`** method of the key object.
2. Convert the hash code to an index using the same method as the **`put`** function.
3. Iterate through the nodes in the bucket at the calculated index to search for the node with the matching key. If a node with the matching key is found, return true. If no node with the matching key is found, return false.

The implementation of the **`containsKey(K key)`** function in a HashMap can vary depending on the specific implementation details, but these are the basic steps involved in checking whether the HashMap contains a mapping for the specified key. Note that this implementation has an average time complexity of O(1), which makes it very efficient for large maps.

### get() Function

The **`get`** function implementation of a HashMap is responsible for retrieving the value associated with a given key. Here's a high-level overview of the **`get`** function implementation:

1. Calculate the hash code of the key using the **`hashCode()`** method of the key object.
2. Convert the hash code to an index using the same method as the **`put`** and **`containsKey`** functions.
3. Iterate through the nodes in the bucket at the calculated index to search for the node with the matching key. If a node with the matching key is found, return its associated value. If no node with the matching key is found, return null.

The implementation of the **`get`** function in a HashMap can vary depending on the specific implementation details, but these are the basic steps involved in retrieving the value associated with a given key. Note that this implementation has an average time complexity of O(1), which makes it very efficient for large maps.

### remove(K key) Function

The **`remove(K key)`** function implementation of a HashMap is responsible for removing the mapping for a specified key from the HashMap. Here's a high-level overview of the **`remove(K key)`** function implementation:

1. Calculate the hash code of the key using the **`hashCode()`** method of the key object.
2. Convert the hash code to an index using the same method as the **`put`**, **`containsKey`**, and **`get`** functions.
3. Iterate through the nodes in the bucket at the calculated index to search for the node with the matching key. If a node with the matching key is found, remove it from the bucket and return its associated value. If no node with the matching key is found, return null.
4. If the number of elements in the HashMap falls below a certain threshold (called the load factor), the HashMap may be resized to conserve memory. This involves creating a new, smaller array and rehashing all the remaining elements in the existing array into the new array.

The implementation of the **`remove(K key)`** function in a HashMap can vary depending on the specific implementation details, but these are the basic steps involved in removing the mapping for a specified key from the HashMap. Note that this implementation has an average time complexity of O(1), which makes it very efficient for large maps.

### keyset() Function

The **`keySet()`** function implementation of an ArrayList-based HashMap is responsible for returning a list of all the keys in the HashMap. Here's a high-level overview of the **`keySet()`** function implementation:

1. Create a new **`ArrayList<K>`** object to hold the keys.
2. Iterate through each bucket in the underlying array and iterate through the nodes in each bucket. For each node, add its key to the **`ArrayList<K>`** object.
3. Return the **`ArrayList<K>`** object.

The implementation of the **`keySet()`** function in an ArrayList-based HashMap can vary depending on the specific implementation details, but these are the basic steps involved in returning a list of all the keys in the HashMap. Note that the order of the keys in the list is not guaranteed to be in any particular order, and that this implementation has an average time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of key-value pairs in the HashMap.
