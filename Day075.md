## Key Concepts

**1. Number Pyramid:**
The **`numPyramid`** function generates a number pyramid pattern where each row contains the number equal to its row number. Let's break down the code and explain each step:

```java
public static void numPyramid(int n) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = n; j >= i; j--) {
            System.out.print(" ");
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            System.out.print(i + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

- The outer loop **`i`** iterates from 1 to **`n`**, representing the row number.
- The first inner loop **`j`** is responsible for printing the spaces before the numbers. It starts from **`n`** (the maximum number of spaces) and decrements with each iteration of the outer loop. This creates a right-aligned pyramid shape.
- The second inner loop **`j`** is responsible for printing the numbers in each row. It iterates **`i`** times, where **`i`** represents the current row number. It prints the number **`i`** followed by a space.
- After printing the numbers in a row, a newline character is added using **`System.out.println()`** to move to the next row.

For example, when you call **`numPyramid(5)`**, it will generate the following pattern:

```
    1
   2 2
  3 3 3
 4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5 5
```

The spaces create the right-aligned pyramid shape, and each row contains the number equal to its row number.

**2. Palindromic Pattern with Number:**
The **`palindromicWithNum`** function generates a palindromic pattern with numbers where each row is a palindrome, consisting of numbers in decreasing order followed by the same numbers in increasing order. Let's break down the code and explain each step:

```java
public static void palindromicWithNum(int n) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = n; j >= i; j--) {
            System.out.print(" ");
        }
        for (int j = i; j >= 1; j--) {
            System.out.print(j);
        }
        for (int j = 2; j <= i; j++) {
            System.out.print(j);
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

- The outer loop **`i`** iterates from 1 to **`n`**, representing the row number.
- The first inner loop **`j`** is responsible for printing the spaces before the numbers, similar to the previous pattern. It creates the right-aligned pyramid shape.
- The second inner loop **`j`** is responsible for printing the numbers in decreasing order from **`i`** to 1. It starts from the current row number **`i`** and decrements with each iteration. It prints the value of **`j`**.
- The third inner loop **`j`** is responsible for printing the numbers in increasing order from 2 to **`i`**. It starts from 2 (since 1 is already printed in the second inner loop) and iterates up to **`i`**. It prints the value of **`j`**.
- After printing the numbers in a row, a newline character is added using **`System.out.println()`** to move to the next row.

For example, when you call **`palindromicWithNum(5)`**, it will generate the following pattern:

```
    1
   212
  32123
 4321234
543212345
```

The spaces create the right-aligned pyramid shape, and each row is a palindrome, with numbers in decreasing order followed by the same numbers in increasing order.

You can customize these patterns by changing the input parameter **`n`** to generate different sizes. Feel free to experiment with different values of **`n`** to see how the patterns change.
