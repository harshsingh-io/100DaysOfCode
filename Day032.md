## Key Concepts

The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is a classic computer science problem that involves finding the longest subsequence that is common to two given sequences. The subsequence does not need to be contiguous, but the order of the elements must be the same. The tabulation approach is a dynamic programming method that can be used to solve this problem efficiently.

The tabulation approach involves building a table (also known as a matrix) to store the solutions to subproblems. The table is filled in a bottom-up manner, starting with the base cases and working towards the final solution.

Here is the pseudocode for the LCS problem using the tabulation approach:

```
function LCSLength(X[1..m], Y[1..n])
    // Create a (m+1) x (n+1) table to store the lengths of LCSs for prefixes of X and Y
    // Initialize the first row and column to 0
    for i from 0 to m
        C[i,0] = 0
    for j from 0 to n
        C[0,j] = 0

    // Fill in the table using dynamic programming
    for i from 1 to m
        for j from 1 to n
            if X[i] == Y[j]
                C[i,j] = C[i-1,j-1] + 1
            else
                C[i,j] = max(C[i,j-1], C[i-1,j])

    // Return the length of the LCS
    return C[m,n]
```

Let's break down what's happening in this pseudocode. The function **`LCSLength`** takes in two sequences **`X`** and **`Y`** of lengths **`m`** and **`n`**, respectively. It returns the length of the LCS for these two sequences.

The first step is to create a table **`C`** with dimensions **`(m+1) x (n+1)`**. This table will be used to store the lengths of the LCSs for prefixes of **`X`** and **`Y`**. The first row and column of the table are initialized to 0, as the LCS of any sequence with an empty sequence is 0.

Next, the table is filled in using dynamic programming. We loop over all possible pairs of indices **`(i,j)`** where **`i`** is between 1 and **`m`**, and **`j`** is between 1 and **`n`**. If the **`i`**-th element of **`X`** is equal to the **`j`**-th element of **`Y`**, then we can extend the LCS by one and add this common element to the subsequence. We look up the length of the LCS for the prefixes without the last element (i.e., **`C[i-1,j-1]`**) and add one to get the length of the LCS for the full sequences. If the elements are not equal, then we take the maximum of the lengths of the LCSs for the prefixes without the last element of **`X`** and the prefixes without the last element of **`Y`**.

Finally, we return the length of the LCS, which is stored in the bottom-right corner of the table.
