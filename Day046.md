## Key Concepts

## **Problem Statement**

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array. Each element in the array represents the maximum jump length from that position. Determine the minimum number of jumps you must take to reach the last index of the array. If it is not possible to reach the last index, return -1.

## **Explanation**

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the end of the given array. Each element in the array represents the maximum jump length from that position. For example, if the value at index i is 3, then we can jump to any index between i+1 and i+3.

## **Implementation**

We can solve the problem using the tabulation approach. We can define a one-dimensional array dp, where dp[i] represents the minimum number of jumps required to reach the end of the array starting from index i. We start filling the array from the end to the beginning, where dp[n-1] will be 0 because it is the last index of the array. For each element, we calculate the minimum number of jumps required to reach the end of the array. We do this by iterating through all the indices that can be reached from the current index and take the minimum of all such values. If it is not possible to reach the last index, then we return -1.

## **Approach**

1. Create a one-dimensional array dp of size n, where dp[i] represents the minimum number of jumps required to reach the end of the array starting from index i. Initialize all the values to -1.
2. Set dp[n-1] to 0 because it is the last index of the array.
3. Traverse the array from right to left, and for each index i:
a. Get the maximum number of steps we can take from this index by getting the value at nums[i].
b. For each index j that can be reached from i, check if dp[j] has already been calculated. If so, update dp[i] with the minimum of dp[j] + 1 and its current value.
c. If there is no such index j that can be reached from i, then dp[i] will remain -1.
4. Return dp[0], which represents the minimum number of jumps required to reach the end of the array starting from the beginning.

## **Pseudocode**

```
minJumps(nums):
    n = length of nums
    dp = one-dimensional array of size n, initialized to -1
    dp[n-1] = 0
    for i from n-2 to 0:
        steps = nums[i]
        ans = infinity
        for j from i+1 to i+steps and j < n:
            if dp[j] != -1:
                ans = minimum(ans, dp[j] + 1)
        if ans != infinity:
            dp[i] = ans
    return dp[0]
```

- The time complexity of the tabulation approach to solve this problem is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array.
- However, there is also a more optimized solution that uses a greedy approach with a time complexity of O(n), which can be useful for larger input sizes.
- The greedy approach involves keeping track of the maximum reachable index at each step, and the number of jumps required to reach that index. We initialize two variables: "maxReach" (the maximum reachable index so far) and "steps" (the number of jumps required to reach the current index). At each index, we update the "maxReach" if it's greater than the current maximum reachable index, and decrement "steps" if we've reached the maximum index that we can jump to from the current index. If "steps" becomes 0, we know we need to make a jump, so we increment the number of jumps and set "steps" to the difference between the current index and the new "maxReach". Finally, we return the number of jumps required to reach the last index of the array.

Here's the pseudocode for the greedy approach:

```
initialize maxReach to nums[0]
initialize steps to nums[0]
initialize jumps to 0

for each index i from 1 to n-1:
    update maxReach to the maximum of maxReach and i + nums[i]
    decrement steps by 1
    if steps becomes 0:
        increment jumps by 1
        set steps to maxReach - i

return jumps
```

- It's worth noting that the greedy approach may not always produce the optimal solution, and there are certain input cases where the tabulation approach is required to find the minimum number of jumps. However, for most practical use cases, the greedy approach is sufficient and much faster than the tabulation approach.

## Code Snippets

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinimumArrayJump {
    public static int minJumps(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(dp, -1);
        dp[n - 1] = 0;

        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            int steps = nums[i];
            int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= i + steps && j < n; j++) {
                if (dp[j] != -1) {
                    ans = Math.min(ans, dp[j] + 1);
                }
            }
            if (ans != Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                dp[i] = ans;
            }
        }
        //dp[i] -> i to n-1
        return dp[0];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {2, 3, 1, 1, 4};
        System.out.println(minJumps(nums));
    }
}
```
