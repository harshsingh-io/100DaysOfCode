## Key Concepts

### Kth Ancestor Of A Node Problem

# **Problem Statement:**

Given a binary tree and a target node, find the kth ancestor of the target node.

# **Example:**

```
markdownCopy code
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \   \
    4   5   6
             \
              7

```

kth ancestor of node 5 with k = 2: 1

# **Explanation:**

The kth ancestor of a target node in a binary tree is the node that is at a distance of k edges above the target node. In the given example, the kth ancestor of node 5 with k = 2 is node 1, as we need to traverse two edges up from node 5 to reach node 1.

# **Approach:**

To find the kth ancestor of a target node, we can follow these steps:

1. If the current node is null, return -1.
2. If the current node's data matches the target node's data, return 0.
3. Recursively call **`kAncestor`** on the left and right subtrees.
4. If both the left and right subtree distances are -1, it means the target node is not present in the tree, so return -1.
5. Calculate the maximum of the left and right subtree distances.
6. If the maximum distance plus 1 equals k, it means the current node is the kth ancestor. Print the current node's data.
7. Return the maximum distance plus 1.

# **Pseudocode:**

```
kotlinCopy code
kAncestor(root, n, k):
    if root is null:
        return -1

    if root.data is equal to n:
        return 0

    leftDistance = kAncestor(root.left, n, k)
    rightDistance = kAncestor(root.right, n, k)

    if leftDistance is -1 and rightDistance is -1:
        return -1

    maxDistance = max(leftDistance, rightDistance)

    if maxDistance + 1 is equal to k:
        print root.data

    return maxDistance + 1

```

# **Dry Run:**

Given binary tree:

```
markdownCopy code
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \   \
    4   5   6
             \
              7

```

Finding the 2nd ancestor of node 5.

        - Recursively call **`kAncestor`** on the left subtree (null, 5, 2).
            - The left subtree is null, so return -1.
        - Recursively call **`kAncestor`** on the right subtree (null, 5, 2).
            - The right subtree is null, so return -1.
        - Both the left and right subtree distances are -1.

        - Check if the current node (5) is null. It is not null.
        - Check if the current node's data (5) matches the target node's data (5). They match.
        - Return 0.
    - The left subtree distance is -1 and the right subtree distance is 0.
    - Return 0 + 1 = 1.
4. Recursively call **`kAncestor`** on the right subtree (3, 5, 2).
    - Check if the current node (3) is null. It is not null.
    - Check if the current node's data (3) matches the target node's data (5). They do not match.
    - Recursively call **`kAncestor`** on the left subtree (null, 5, 2).
        - The left subtree is null, so return -1.
    - Recursively call **`kAncestor`** on the right subtree (6, 5, 2).
        - Check if the current node (6) is null. It is not null.
        - Check if the current node's data (6) matches the target node's data (5). They do not match.
        - Recursively call **`kAncestor`** on the left subtree (null, 5, 2).
            - The left subtree is null, so return -1.
        - Recursively call **`kAncestor`** on the right subtree (7, 5, 2).
            - Check if the current node (7) is null. It is not null.
            - Check if the current node's data (7) matches the target node's data (5). They do not match.
            - Recursively call **`kAncestor`** on the left subtree (null, 5, 2).
                - The left subtree is null, so return -1.
            - Recursively call **`kAncestor`** on the right subtree (null, 5, 2).
                - The right subtree is null, so return -1.
            - Both the left and right subtree distances are -1.
            - Return -1.
        - The left subtree distance is -1 and the right subtree distance is -1.
        - Return -1.
    - Both the left and right subtree distances are -1.
    - Return -1.
5. Both the left and right subtree distances are -1.
6. Return -1.

The 2nd ancestor of node 5 is not present in the tree, so the function returns -1.

### Transform To A SumTree Problem

# **Problem Statement:**

Given a binary tree, transform it into a sum tree, where each node's value is the sum of its left and right subtrees' values. The leaf nodes will have a value of 0.

# **Example:**

```
             10                   20
           /    \               /    \
         -2      6     =>      4      12
        /  \    / \           / \     / \
       8   -4  7   5         0   0   0   0
```

# **Explanation:**

The given binary tree is transformed into a sum tree by replacing each node's value with the sum of its left and right subtrees' values. The leaf nodes have a value of 0.

# **Approach:**

To transform a binary tree into a sum tree, we can follow these steps:

1. If the current node is null, return 0.
2. Recursively call **`transformSumTree`** on the left and right subtrees to obtain their sum tree values.
3. Store the current node's original data in a variable.
4. Calculate the sum of the left and right subtrees' values.
5. Update the current node's data with the sum of the subtrees' values.
6. Return the sum of the original data and the sum of the subtrees' values.

# **Pseudocode:**

```
transformSumTree(root):
    if root is null:
        return 0

    leftSum = transformSumTree(root.left)
    rightSum = transformSumTree(root.right)

    data = root.data
    root.data = leftSum + rightSum

    return data + root.data
```

# **Dry Run:**

Given binary tree:

```
             10
           /    \
         -2      6
        /  \    / \
       8   -4  7   5
```

Transforming the binary tree into a sum tree.

        - Check if the current node (8) is null. It is not null.
        - Return 0.
    - Recursively call **`transformSumTree`** on the right subtree (-4, -4).
        - Check if the current node (-4) is null. It is not null.
        - Return 0.
    - The left subtree sum is 0, and the right subtree sum is 0.
    - Store the current node's original data (-2) in the variable.
    - Calculate the sum of the subtrees' values: leftSum (0) + rightSum (0) = 0.
    - Update the current node's data with the sum of the subtrees' values: root.data = 0.
    - Return the sum of the original data (-2) and the sum of the subtrees' values (0): -2 + 0 = -2.
3. Recursively call **`transformSumTree`** on the right subtree (6, 6).
    - Check if the current node (6) is null. It is not null.
    - Recursively call **`transformSumTree`** on the left subtree (7, 7).

        - Return 0.
    - The left subtree sum is 0, and the right subtree sum is 0.
    - Store the current node's original data (6) in the variable.
    - Calculate the sum of the subtrees' values: leftSum (0) + rightSum (0) = 0.
    - Update the current node's data with the sum of the subtrees' values: root.data = 0.
    - Return the sum of the original data (6) and the sum of the subtrees' values (0): 6 + 0 = 6.
4. The left subtree sum is -2, and the right subtree sum is 6.
5. Store the current node's original data (10) in the variable.
6. Calculate the sum of the subtrees' values: leftSum (-2) + rightSum (6) = 4.
7. Update the current node's data with the sum of the subtrees' values: root.data = 4.
8. Return the sum of the original data (10) and the sum of the subtrees' values (4): 10 + 4 = 14.

The binary tree is transformed into a sum tree as follows:

```
             20
           /    \
          4      12
         / \    /  \
        0   0  0    0
```

        }
        int max = Math.max(leftDistance, rightDistance);

        if (max + 1 == k) {
            System.out.println(root.data);
        }
        return max + 1;
    }
```

```java
public static int transformSumTree(Node root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        int leftChild = transformSumTree(root.left);
        int rightChild = transformSumTree(root.right);
        int data = root.data;
        int newLeft = root.left == null ? 0 : root.left.data; // when we are on leaf node we cant fetch the data of null code
        int newRight = root.right == null ? 0 : root.right.data; // when we are on leaf node we cant fetch the data of null code
        root.data = newLeft + leftChild + newRight + rightChild;
        return data;
    }
```
