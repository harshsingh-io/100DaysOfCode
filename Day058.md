## Key Concepts

### SORTING IN ARRAYLIST

In Java, sorting an ArrayList can be done easily using the Collections class and Collection interface. The Collections class provides various sorting methods that can be used to sort an ArrayList in ascending or descending order.

To sort an ArrayList in ascending order, we can use the Collections.sort() method. This method sorts the elements of the ArrayList in their natural order (i.e., the order defined by the Comparable interface).

To sort an ArrayList in descending order, we can use the Collections.reverseOrder() method. This method returns a comparator that reverses the natural order of the elements.

Here's an example code that sorts an ArrayList named "list" in ascending and descending order:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;

public class SortingArrayList {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an ArrayList of strings
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
        list.add("apple");
        list.add("banana");
        list.add("orange");
        list.add("grape");

        // Sorting the ArrayList in ascending order
        Collections.sort(list);
        System.out.println("Sorted ArrayList in ascending order:");
        System.out.println(list);

        // Sorting the ArrayList in descending order
        Collections.sort(list, Collections.reverseOrder());
        System.out.println("Sorted ArrayList in descending order:");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Sorted ArrayList in ascending order:
[apple, banana, grape, orange]
Sorted ArrayList in descending order:
[orange, grape, banana, apple]
```

In the above code, the Collections.sort() method is used to sort the ArrayList "list" in ascending order, and the Collections.reverseOrder() method is used to sort it in descending order. Both methods modify the original ArrayList in place.

### MULTI-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY

A multidimensional ArrayList in Java is an ArrayList that can store elements in multiple dimensions or nested ArrayLists. It is useful when we want to store and manipulate data in a matrix or table-like format. The multidimensional ArrayList can be created using the nested ArrayList approach. We create an ArrayList of ArrayLists where each inner ArrayList represents a row or a column of the matrix.

For example, let's say we have three lists of multiples of 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and we want to store them in a multidimensional ArrayList. We can do it as follows:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class MultiDimArrayListExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> mainList = new ArrayList<>();

        // list 1
        ArrayList<Integer> list1 = new ArrayList<>();
        // list 2
        ArrayList<Integer> list2 = new ArrayList<>();
        // list 3
        ArrayList<Integer> list3 = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i=1; i<=5; i++) {
            list1.add(i*1);
						list2.add(i*2);
            list3.add(i*3);

        }
        mainList.add(list1);
        mainList.add(list2);
        mainList.add(list3);

        System.out.println(mainList);
    }
}
```

In the above code, we have created a **`mainList`** that contains three ArrayLists. Each of these ArrayLists contains the multiples of 1, 2, and 3, respectively. We have created the three individual lists (**`list1`**, **`list2`**, and **`list3`**) using a for loop and added them to the **`mainList`** using the **`add()`** method.

To access an element from the multidimensional ArrayList, we use nested **`get()`** methods. For example, to access the element in the first row and second column, we use **`mainList.get(0).get(1)`**.

### Find and Remove Nth node from end in Linkedlist

- Problem description: Given a singly linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.
- Approach: The approach used in the code is to first calculate the size of the linked list and then traverse to the node before the nth node from the end and update its next pointer to skip over the nth node.
- Pseudocode:

```java
public static void deleteNthfromEnd(int n) {
    int sz = 0;
    Node temp = head;
    while(temp != null) {
        temp = temp.next;
        sz++;
    }
    if (n == sz) {
        head = head.next;
        return;
    }
    int i = 1;
    int iToFind = sz - n;
    Node prev = head;
    while (i < iToFind) {
        prev = prev.next;
        i++;
    }
    prev.next = prev.next.next;
    return;
}
```

- Code explanation: The code starts by initializing a variable **`sz`** to 0 and a temporary node **`temp`** to the head of the linked list. A while loop is used to traverse the linked list until **`temp`** is null, at which point **`sz`** will be equal to the size of the linked list. If the value of **`n`** is equal to **`sz`**, then the head of the linked list is updated to its next node and the function returns. Otherwise, two variables **`i`** and **`iToFind`** are initialized to 1 and **`sz - n`**, respectively. Another temporary node **`prev`** is initialized to the head of the linked list. A while loop is used to traverse the linked list until **`i`** is equal to **`iToFind - 1`**, at which point **`prev`** will be pointing to the node before the nth node from the end. **`prev.next`** is then updated to **`prev.next.next`** to skip over the nth node.
- Key points:
    - The approach used in the code is to calculate the size of the linked list and then traverse to the node before the nth node from the end and update its next pointer to skip over the nth node.
    - The function can be optimized by using two pointers, a slow pointer and a fast pointer, to avoid calculating the size of the linked list.
    - The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the size of the linked list.
- Block representation of linkedlist **`ll = 1->2->3->4->5`** for n=3:

```
Initial linked list:      1    ->    2    ->    3    ->    4    ->    5    ->    null

Delete 3rd node from end:

1. Calculate the size of the linked list:
     sz = 0
     temp = head
     while temp != null
         temp = temp.next
         sz++
     end while
     sz = 5

2. Check if n == sz:
     n = 3, sz = 5
     Condition is false, move to next step

3. Find the (sz - n)th node from the beginning of the linked list:
     i = 1
     iToFind = sz - n = 2
     prev = head
     while i < iToFind
         prev = prev.next
         i++
     end while
     prev = 2nd node

4. Delete the (sz - n)th node:
     prev.next = prev.next.next
     Linked list after deletion:      1    ->    2    ->    4    ->    5    ->    null
```
