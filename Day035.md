## Key Concepts

### EDIT DISTANCE PROBLEM(DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING)

The Edit Distance problem is a classic problem in computer science that involves finding the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into another. The operations allowed are insertion, deletion, and substitution of a single character.

The approach we will use to solve this problem is similar to the Longest Common Subsequence approach. We will create a table of size **`(length1+1) x (length2+1)`** to store the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other.

Here are the steps to solve the Edit Distance problem using the Longest Common Subsequence tabulation approach:

1. Define a function **`edit_distance(string1, string2)`** that takes two input strings.
2. Compute the lengths of the two strings, **`length1`** and **`length2`**, respectively.
3. Create a table **`dp`** of size **`(length1+1) x (length2+1)`** and initialize its first row and column to 0, as we did in the Longest Common Subsequence tabulation approach.
4. Loop over the rows of the table, starting from the second row (**`i=1`**) up to and including the last row (**`i=length1`**).
5. For each row **`i`**, loop over the columns of the table, starting from the second column (**`j=1`**) up to and including the last column (**`j=length2`**).
6. If the characters at positions **`i-1`** and **`j-1`** in **`string1`** and **`string2`** are equal, set **`dp[i][j]`** to the value in **`dp[i-1][j-1]`**.
7. Otherwise, set **`dp[i][j]`** to the minimum of the following three values:
    
    a. **`dp[i-1][j] + 1`** - this represents the cost of deleting the character at position **`i-1`** in **`string1`**.
    
    b. **`dp[i][j-1] + 1`** - this represents the cost of inserting the character at position **`j-1`** in **`string2`** into **`string1`**.
    
    c. **`dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`** - this represents the cost of substituting the character at position **`i-1`** in **`string1`** with the character at position **`j-1`** in **`string2`**.
    
    The minimum of these three values represents the minimum number of operations required to transform **`string1[0:i]`** into **`string2[0:j]`**.
    
8. The final answer is stored in **`dp[length1][length2]`**.
9. Return **`dp[length1][length2]`** as the minimum number of operations required to transform **`string1`** into **`string2`**.

The pseudocode for solving the Edit Distance problem using the Longest Common Subsequence tabulation approach in a language-independent format:

```
function edit_distance(string1, string2):
    length1 = length of string1
    length2 = length of string2
    dp = a table of size (length1+1) x (length2+1)

    for i from 0 to length1:
        dp[i][0] = i

    for j from 0 to length2:
        dp[0][j] = j

    for i from 1 to length1:
        for j from 1 to length2:
            if string1[i-1] == string2[j-1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1

    return dp[length1][length2]
```

I hope this helps!

## Code Snippets

```java
public class EditDistance {
    public static int editDistance(String str1, String str2) {
        int n = str1.length();
        int m = str2.length();
        int dp[][] = new int[n + 1][m + 1];

        //Initialise
        for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m + 1; j++) {
                if (i == 0) dp[i][j] = j;
                if (j == 0) dp[i][j] = i;
            }
        }
        //Bottom Up Approach
        for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < m + 1; j++) {
                if (str1.charAt(i - 1) == str2.charAt(j - 1)) { //same
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                } else { //different
                    int add = dp[i][j - 1];
                    int delete = dp[i - 1][j];
                    int replace = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(Math.min(add, delete), replace) + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][m];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str1 = "intention";
        String str2 = "execution";
        System.out.println(editDistance(str1, str2));
    }
}
```
