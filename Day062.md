## Key Concepts

### Diameter Of A Tree Problem

## **Problem Statement:**

The problem is to find the diameter of a binary tree. The diameter of a binary tree is defined as the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree.

## **Examples:**

Here, we'll consider an example of a binary tree:

```
markdownCopy code
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \
      4   5

```

Output:

- Approach 1 (brute force): Diameter = 4 (Path: 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3)
- Approach 2 (optimized): Diameter = 4 (Path: 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3)

Explanation:
In both approaches, the diameter of the given binary tree is calculated as the longest path between any two nodes. The path in this example is from node 4 to node 3, with a length of 4.

## **Explanation:**

1. Approach 1 (brute force):
    - The **`diameter2`** function calculates the diameter of a binary tree using a brute force approach.
    - It takes a **`root`** node as input.
    - If the **`root`** is **`null`**, it means the tree is empty, so it returns 0 (no diameter).
    - Recursively, it calculates the left subtree's diameter (**`leftDiameter`**) and the right subtree's diameter (**`rightDiameter`**) using the **`diameter2`** function.
    - It also calculates the height of the left subtree (**`leftHeight`**) and the height of the right subtree (**`rightHeight`**) using the **`heightOfTree`** function.
    - The diameter of the current node (**`selfDiameter`**) is calculated as the sum of the heights of the left and right subtrees, plus 1 (for the current node itself).
    - Finally, it returns the maximum value among **`selfDiameter`**, **`leftDiameter`**, and **`rightDiameter`**, which represents the diameter of the binary tree.
2. Approach 2 (optimized):
    - The code defines a nested class **`Info`**, which stores two values: **`diaM`** (diameter) and **`height`**.
    - The **`diameter`** function calculates the diameter of a binary tree using an optimized approach.
    - It takes a **`root`** node as input.
    - If the **`root`** is **`null`**, it means the tree is empty, so it returns an **`Info`** object with **`diaM`** and **`height`** both set to 0.
    - Recursively, it calculates the **`Info`** object for the left subtree (**`leftInfo`**) and the right subtree (**`rightInfo`**) using the **`diameter`** function.
    - The diameter of the current node (**`diam`**) is calculated as the maximum value among the **`diaM`** values of **`leftInfo`**, **`rightInfo`**, and the sum of **`leftInfo.height`**, **`rightInfo.height`**, and 1 (for the current node itself).
    - The height of the current node (**`height`**) is calculated as the maximum value among the **`height`** values of **`leftInfo`** and **`rightInfo`**, plus 1.
    - Finally, it returns an **`Info`** object with the calculated **`diam`** and **`height`** values.

## **Approach:**

The code provides two approaches to calculate the diameter of a binary tree:

1. Approach 1 (brute force):
    - Recursively calculate the diameter of the left subtree and the right subtree.
    - Calculate the height of the left subtree and the right subtree separately.
    - Calculate the diameter of the current node as the sum of the heights of the left and right subtrees, plus 1.
    - Return the maximum value among the current node's diameter, the left subtree's diameter, and the right subtree's diameter.
2. Approach 2 (optimized):
    - Recursively calculate the **`Info`** object for the left subtree and the right subtree.
    - Calculate the diameter of the current node as the maximum value among the left subtree's diameter, the right subtree's diameter, and the sum of the heights of the left and right subtrees, plus 1.
    - Calculate the height of the current node as the maximum value among the heights of the left and right subtrees, plus 1.
    - Return the **`Info`** object with the calculated diameter and height.

## **Pseudocode:**

Approach 1 (brute force):

```
scssCopy code
diameter2(root):
    if root is null:
        return 0

    leftDiameter = diameter2(root.left)
    leftHeight = heightOfTree(root.left)
    rightDiameter = diameter2(root.right)
    rightHeight = heightOfTree(root.right)

    selfDiameter = leftHeight + rightHeight + 1
    return max(selfDiameter, leftDiameter, rightDiameter)

```

Approach 2 (optimized):

```
lessCopy code
Info:
    diaM
    height

diameter(root):
    if root is null:
        return Info(0, 0)

    leftInfo = diameter(root.left)
    rightInfo = diameter(root.right)

    diam = max(leftInfo.diaM, rightInfo.diaM, leftInfo.height + rightInfo.height + 1)
    height = max(leftInfo.height, rightInfo.height) + 1

    return Info(diam, height)

```

### TOP VIEW OF BINARY TREE PROBLEM

# **Problem Statement:**

Given a binary tree, find the top view of the tree. The top view of a binary tree is defined as the nodes visible when looking at the tree from the top.

# **Example:**

```
markdownCopy code
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \   \
    4   5   6
             \
              7

```

Top view: 4, 2, 1, 3, 6, 7

# **Explanation:**

The top view of a binary tree represents the nodes that are visible when looking at the tree from the top. It means that for each horizontal distance, we only consider the node that is first encountered at that distance from the vertical axis.

# **Approach:**

To find the top view of the binary tree, we can use level order traversal. We traverse the tree level by level and maintain a HashMap to store the horizontal distance and the node at that distance. We also keep track of the minimum and maximum horizontal distance encountered so far.

1. Create an empty queue for level order traversal.
2. Create an empty HashMap to store the nodes at each horizontal distance.
3. Initialize the minimum and maximum horizontal distances as 0.
4. Add the root node to the queue with a horizontal distance of 0.
5. While the queue is not empty:
    - Remove the front element from the queue.
    - If the removed element is null, it means we have completed one level of traversal. If the queue is not empty, add null again to mark the end of the current level.
    - If the current horizontal distance is not present in the HashMap, add the node to the HashMap with the current horizontal distance.
    - Check if the left child of the current node exists. If it does, add it to the queue with a horizontal distance of **`current_hd - 1`** and update the minimum horizontal distance if necessary.
    - Check if the right child of the current node exists. If it does, add it to the queue with a horizontal distance of **`current_hd + 1`** and update the maximum horizontal distance if necessary.
6. Iterate from the minimum horizontal distance to the maximum horizontal distance and print the nodes from the HashMap.

# **Pseudocode:**

```
csharpCopy code
Infos:
    Node node
    int hd

topView(root):
    q = new Queue<Infos>()
    map = new HashMap<Integer, Node>()
    min = 0
    max = 0

    q.add(new Infos(root, 0))
    q.add(null)

    while q is not empty:
        curr = q.remove()

        if curr is null:
            if q is empty:
                break
            else:
                q.add(null)

        if curr.hd is not present in map:
            map.put(curr.hd, curr.node)

        if curr.node has a left child:
            q.add(new Infos(curr.node.left, curr.hd - 1))
            min = min(min, curr.hd - 1)

        if curr.node has a right child:
            q.add(new Infos(curr.node.right, curr.hd + 1))
            max = max(max, curr.hd + 1)

    for i from min to max:
        print map.get(i).data

```

# **Dry Run:**

Given binary tree:

```
markdownCopy code
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \   \
    4   5   6
             \
              7

```

1. Initialize the queue, map, min, and max.
2. Add the root node (1) to the queue with a horizontal distance of 0.
3. Add null to mark the end of the first level.
4. Start the level order traversal.
    - Remove 1 from the queue.
    - Add 1 to the map with hd = 0.
    - Add 2 to the queue with hd = -1 and update min = -1.
    - Add 3 to the queue with hd = 1 and update max = 1.
    - Remove null from the queue.
    - Add null to mark the end of the second level.
    - Remove 2 from the queue.
    - Add 2 to the map with hd = -1.
    - Add 4 to the queue with hd = -2 and update min = -2.
    - Add 5 to the queue with hd = 0.
    - Remove 3 from the queue.
    - Add 3 to the map with hd = 1.
    - Add 6 to the queue with hd = 2 and update max = 2.
    - Remove null from the queue.
    - Add null to mark the end of the third level.
    - Remove 4 from the queue.
    - Skip adding 4 to the map as hd = -2 is already present.
    - Remove 5 from the queue.
    - Skip adding 5 to the map as hd = 0 is already present.
    - Remove 6 from the queue.
    - Add 6 to the map with hd = 2.
    - Add 7 to the queue with hd = 3 and update max = 3.
    - Remove null from the queue.
    - The queue is empty, so exit the loop.
5. Iterate from min = -2 to max = 3 and print the nodes from the map.
    - Print 4.
    - Print 2.
    - Print 1.
    - Print 3.
    - Print 6.
    - Print 7.

The top view of the given binary tree is: 4, 2, 1, 3, 6, 7.
