## Key Concepts

# **Tiling Problem with Fibonacci Approach**

## **Problem Statement**

You are given a wall of size 4 x N. You have an unlimited supply of tiles of size 4 x 1. You need to find the number of ways to arrange the tiles on the wall to fully cover it.

## **Fibonacci Approach**

The Fibonacci approach involves using the recurrence relation of the Fibonacci sequence to calculate the number of ways to fill the wall.

### **Recurrence Relation**

Let T(n) be the number of ways to tile a 4 x n wall.

We can tile the wall using either one of the following arrangements:

- Place a tile vertically on the leftmost side, then tile the remaining 4 x (n-1) wall (T(n-1))
- Place two tiles horizontally on the leftmost side, then tile the remaining 4 x (n-4) wall (T(n-4))

Therefore, we have the following recurrence relation:
T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-4)

### **Base Cases**

We need to define the base cases for our recurrence relation.

- When n = 0 or n = 1, there is only one way to fill the wall, i.e., by not placing any tiles.
- When n = 2 or n = 3, it is not possible to fill the wall using only 4 x 1 tiles.

Therefore, we have the following base cases:

- T(0) = T(1) = 1
- T(2) = T(3) = 0

### **Implementation**

We can implement the Fibonacci approach using recursion.

```
countWays(n):
    a = 1
    b = 2
    if n == 1:
        return a
    else if n == 2:
        return b
    else:
        for i from 3 to n:
            c = a + b
            a = b
            b = c
        return b
```

## **Example**

Suppose we want to find the number of ways to fill a 4 x 5 wall. Using the Fibonacci approach, we can calculate:

```
T(5) = T(4) + T(1)
     = T(3) + T(0) + 1
     = 0 + 1 + 1
     = 2
```

Therefore, there are 2 ways to fill the wall.

## Code Snippets

```java
public static int countWays(int n) {
    int a = 1, b = 2;
    if (n == 1) {
        return a;
    } else if (n == 2) {
        return b;
    } else {
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            int c = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = c;
        }
        return b;
    }
}
```
