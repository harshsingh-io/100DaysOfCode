## Key Concepts

### Max Area In Histogram

**Problem Statement:**
Given an array representing the heights of bars in a histogram, find the maximum possible area of a rectangle that can be formed by the bars.

**Examples:**

- Example 1:
    
    ```
    Input: arr = [1, 4, 3, 5, 6]
    Output: 12
    Explanation: The histogram can be visualized as follows:
                  #
                  #     #
               #  #     #
               #  #  #  #
               #  #  #  #
             -------------
    The largest rectangle that can be formed is highlighted with 'X' and has an area of 12.
    ```
    
- Example 2:
    
    ```
    Input: arr = [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3]
    Output: 10
    Explanation: The histogram can be visualized as follows:
                  #
                  #     #
               #  #     #
               #  #  #  #
               #  #  #  #
             -------------
    The largest rectangle that can be formed is highlighted with 'X' and has an area of 10.
    ```
    

**Explanation:**

- The problem requires finding the maximum area of a rectangle that can be formed using the bars of a histogram.
- The width of the rectangle will be determined by the number of bars it spans.
- The height of the rectangle will be determined by the minimum height of the bars within the span.
- We need to find the maximum possible area by considering all possible rectangles that can be formed using the bars.

**Approach:**

- We will use a stack and iterate through the bars of the histogram.
- For each bar, we will maintain two arrays:
    - **`nsl`** (Next Smaller Element to the Left): This array will store the index of the next smaller bar to the left of the current bar.
    - **`nsr`** (Next Smaller Element to the Right): This array will store the index of the next smaller bar to the right of the current bar.
- Once we have the **`nsl`** and **`nsr`** arrays, we can calculate the area of the rectangle formed using each bar as the smallest bar.
- The maximum area among all the rectangles will be the result.

**Pseudocode:**

```
maxArea(arr):
    maxArea = 0
    nsl = array of size arr.length
    nsr = array of size arr.length
    s = empty stack

    // Next smaller element to the left
    for i from 0 to arr.length - 1:
        while s is not empty and arr[s.top()] >= arr[i]:
            s.pop()
        if s is empty:
            nsl[i] = -1
        else:
            nsl[i] = s.top()
        s.push(i)

    // Next smaller element to the right
    s = empty stack
    for i from arr.length - 1 to 0:
        while s is not empty and arr[s.top()] >= arr[i]:
            s.pop()
        if s is empty:
            nsr[i] = arr.length
        else:
            nsr[i] = s.top()
        s.push(i)

    // Calculate maximum area of rectangle
    for i from 0 to arr.length - 1:
        height = arr[i]
        width = nsr[i] - nsl[i] - 1
        currArea = height * width
        maxArea = max(maxArea, currArea)

    print maxArea
```

**Dry Run:**
Consider the following input:

```
arr = [1, 4, 3, 5, 6]
```

- Initially, **`maxArea`** is 0.
- Create empty arrays **`nsl`** and **`nsr`** of size 5.
- Create an empty stack **`s`**.
- Start iterating through the array from left to right.
    - For the first bar with height 1, the stack is empty.
        - Push index 0 to the stack.
    - For the second bar with height 4, the stack contains index 0.
        - Since the height of the bar at index 0 (1) is smaller than the current bar's height (4), the while loop doesn't execute.
        - Push index 1 to the stack.
    - For the third bar with height 3, the stack contains indices 0 and 1.
        - Since the height of the bar at index 1 (4) is greater than the current bar's height (3), pop index 1 from the stack.
        - Now the stack contains index 0.
        - Push index 2 to the stack.
    - For the fourth bar with height 5, the stack contains index 0 and 2.
        - Since the height of the bar at index 2 (3) is smaller than the current bar's height (5), the while loop doesn't execute.
        - Push index 3 to the stack.
    - For the fifth bar with height 6, the stack contains indices 0, 2, and 3.
        - Since the height of the bar at index 3 (5) is smaller than the current bar's height (6), the while loop doesn't execute.
        - Push index 4 to the stack.
    - The iteration through the array is complete.
- Reset the stack **`s`** to an empty stack.
- Start iterating through the array from right to left.
    - For the last bar with height 6, the stack is empty.
        - Push index 4 to the stack.
    - For the fourth bar with height 5, the stack contains index 4.
        - Since the height of the bar at index 4 (6) is greater than the current bar's height (5), pop index 4 from the stack.
        - Now the stack is empty.
        - Push index 3 to the stack.
    - For the third bar with height 3, the stack contains index 3.
        - Since the height of the bar at index 3 (5) is greater than the current bar's height (3), pop index 3 from the stack.
        - Now the stack is empty.
        - Push index 2 to the stack.
    - For the second bar with height 4, the stack contains index 2.
        - Since the height of the bar at index 2 (3) is greater than the current bar's height (4), pop index 2 from the stack.
        - Now the stack is empty.
        - Push index 1 to the stack.
    - For the first bar with height 1, the stack contains index 1.
        - Since the height of the bar at index 1 (4) is greater than the current bar's height (1), pop index 1 from the stack.
        - Now the stack is empty.
        - Push index 0 to the stack.
    - The iteration through the array is complete.
- Iterate through the array to calculate the maximum area of the rectangle.
    - For the first bar at index 0 with height 1, the width is 5 (nsr[0] - nsl[0] - 1).
        - Calculate the current area as 1 * 5 = 5.
        - Update **`maxArea`** to 5.
    - For the second bar at index 1 with height 4, the width is 3 (nsr[1] - nsl[1] - 1).
        - Calculate the current area as 4 * 3 = 12.
        - Update **`maxArea`** to 12.
    - For the third bar at index 2 with height 3, the width is 1 (nsr[2] - nsl[2] - 1).
        - Calculate the current area as 3 * 1 = 3.
        - Update **`maxArea`** to 12 (no change).
    - For the fourth bar at index 3 with height 5, the width is 1 (nsr[3] - nsl[3] - 1).
        - Calculate the current area as 5 * 1 = 5.
        - Update **`maxArea`** to 12 (no change).
    - For the fifth bar at index 4 with height 6, the width is 1 (nsr[4] - nsl[4] - 1).
        - Calculate the current area as 6 * 1 = 6.
        - Update **`maxArea`** to 12 (no change).
- The iteration through the array is complete.
- The maximum area of a rectangle that can be formed is 12.
- Print **`maxArea`**, which is 12.

//        Maximum area of rectangle formed in histogram
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length ; i++){
            int height = arr[i];
//            for width j-i-1 -> nsr[i] - nsl[j] - 1
            int width = nsr[i] - nsl[i] - 1;
            int currArea =  height*width;
            maxArea = Math.max(currArea,maxArea);
        }
        System.out.println(maxArea);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
				// Max Area of histogram of rectangle
