## Key Concepts

### TARJAN’S ALGORITHM

**Problem Statement: Bridges in a Graph using Tarjan's Algorithm**

Given a connected undirected graph, find all the bridges in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal disconnects the graph into two or more components.

**Example:**
Consider the following graph:

```
      0
     /|\
    / | \
   1--2--3
      |\
      | \
      4--5
```

The bridges in this graph are:

- Bridge: 0 -- 3
- Bridge: 2 -- 3

**Explanation:**
Removing the edges (0, 3) or (2, 3) will disconnect the graph into two separate components.

**Approach:**

- Implement the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the graph and find the bridges.
- Initialize the discovery time (**`dt`**), low time (**`low`**), visited array (**`vis`**), and a time variable.
- For each vertex in the graph, if it has not been visited, call the DFS function.
- In the DFS function, mark the current vertex as visited and assign the discovery time and low time values.
- Iterate through the neighbors of the current vertex.
    - If the neighbor is the parent of the current vertex, ignore it.
    - If the neighbor has not been visited, recursively call the DFS function for the neighbor.
        - Update the low time of the current vertex based on the low time of the neighbor.
        - If the discovery time of the current vertex is less than the low time of the neighbor, it indicates a bridge.
            - Print the bridge (current vertex -- neighbor).
    - If the neighbor has been visited, update the low time of the current vertex based on the discovery time of the neighbor.
- Implement the **`tarjanAlgo`** function to initialize the required arrays and call the DFS function for each vertex.
- In the main function, create the graph and call the **`tarjanAlgo`** function to find the bridges.

**Pseudocode:**

```
DFS function:
    Mark the current vertex as visited.
    Assign the discovery time and low time values for the current vertex.
    Iterate through the neighbors of the current vertex:
        If the neighbor is the parent of the current vertex, ignore it.
        If the neighbor has not been visited:
            Recursively call the DFS function for the neighbor.
            Update the low time of the current vertex based on the low time of the neighbor.
            If the discovery time of the current vertex is less than the low time of the neighbor:
                Print the bridge (current vertex -- neighbor).
        If the neighbor has been visited:
            Update the low time of the current vertex based on the discovery time of the neighbor.

Tarjan's Algorithm function:
    Initialize the required arrays and variables.
    For each vertex in the graph:
        If it has not been visited:
            Call the DFS function for the vertex.

Main function:
    Create the graph.
    Call the Tarjan's Algorithm function.
```

**Dry Run:**
Consider the given graph:

```
      0
     /|\
    / | \
   1--2--3
      |\
      | \
      4--5
```

- Create an array of ArrayLists named **`graph`** to represent the graph.
- Initialize the graph with the given edges.
- Call the **`tarjanAlgo`** function.
- Initialize the **`dt`**, **`low`**, and **`vis`** arrays with size 6 (number of vertices).
- Initialize the **`time`** variable to 0.
- Start iterating through the vertices of the graph.
    - For vertex 0:
        - Call the DFS function for vertex 0 with parent -1.
            - Mark vertex 0 as visited.
            - Assign discovery time and low time as 1.
            - Iterate through the neighbors of vertex 0.
                - Vertex 1 is the neighbor.
                    - Vertex 1 is not visited, so call the DFS function for vertex 1.
                        - Mark vertex 1 as visited.
                        - Assign discovery time and low time as 2.
                        - Iterate through the neighbors of vertex 1.
                            - Vertex 0 is the neighbor (parent), so ignore it.

                                        - Vertex 0 is the neighbor (parent), so ignore it.
                                        - Vertex 1 is the neighbor.
                                            - Vertex 1 is already visited, so update the low time of vertex 2 based on the discovery time of vertex 1 (2).
                                    - No bridges found for vertex 2.

                                    - Mark vertex 3 as visited.
                                    - Assign discovery time and low time as 4.

    - Continue iterating through the remaining vertices (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) following the same process.
- After traversing all the vertices, the bridges in the graph are:
    - Bridge: 0 -- 3
    - Bridge: 2 -- 3
