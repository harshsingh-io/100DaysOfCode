## Key Concepts

### Sorted Array to Balanced BST

**Problem Statement:**

Given a sorted array, create a balanced Binary Search Tree (BST) from it.

**Example:**

Input:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Output:
A balanced BST with the following structure:

```

       4
     /   \
    2     6
   / \   / \
  1   3 5   7
```

**Explanation:**

The given sorted array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The goal is to create a balanced BST from this array. A balanced BST has the property that for any node, the difference in the heights of its left and right subtrees is at most 1.

**Approach:**

To create a balanced BST from a sorted array, we can follow these steps:

1. Check if the start index is greater than the end index. If so, return null to indicate an empty subtree.
2. Calculate the middle index as (start + end) / 2.
3. Create a new node with the value at the middle index as the data.
4. Recursively call **`createArrBalBST`** on the left subarray from the start index to the middle index - 1. Set the returned value as the left child of the current node.
5. Recursively call **`createArrBalBST`** on the right subarray from the middle index + 1 to the end index. Set the returned value as the right child of the current node.
6. Return the current node.

**Pseudocode:**

```

createArrBalBST(arr, start, end):
    if start > end:
        return null

    mid = (start + end) / 2
    root = new Node(arr[mid])
    root.left = createArrBalBST(arr, start, mid - 1)
    root.right = createArrBalBST(arr, mid + 1, end)

    return root
```

**Dry Run:**

Given sorted array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Initially, **`createArrBalBST(arr, 0, 6)`** is called.

1. Check if start index 0 is greater than end index 6. It is not, so continue.
2. Calculate the middle index as (0 + 6) / 2 = 3.
3. Create a new node with the value at the middle index (arr[3] = 4) as the data.
4. Recursively call **`createArrBalBST`** on the left subarray from the start index 0 to the middle index - 1 = 2. Set the returned value as the left child of the current node.
    - **`createArrBalBST(arr, 0, 2)`** is called.
        - Check if start index 0 is greater than end index 2. It is not, so continue.
        - Calculate the middle index as (0 + 2) / 2 = 1.
        - Create a new node with the value at the middle index (arr[1] = 2) as the data.
        - Recursively call **`createArrBalBST`** on the left subarray from the start index 0 to the middle index - 1 = 0. Set the returned value as the left child of the current node.
            - **`createArrBalBST(arr, 0, 0)`** is called.
                - Check if start index 0 is greater than end index 0. It is not, so continue.
                - Calculate the middle index as (0 + 0) / 2 = 0.
                - Create a new node with the value at the middle index (arr[0] = 1) as the data.
                - Return the current node.
            - The left child of the current node is set to the node returned from the previous step.
        - Recursively call **`createArrBalBST`** on the right subarray from the middle index + 1 = 2 to the end index 2. Set the returned value as the right child of the current node.
            - **`createArrBalBST(arr, 2, 2)`** is called.
                - Check if start index 2 is greater than end index 2. It is not, so continue.
                - Calculate the middle index as (2 + 2) / 2 = 2.
                - Create a new node with the value at the middle index (arr[2] = 3) as the data.
                - Return the current node.
            - The right child of the current node is set to the node returned from the previous step.
        - Return the current node.
    - The left child of the current node is set to the node returned from the previous step.
5. Recursively call **`createArrBalBST`** on the right subarray from the middle index + 1 = 4 to the end index 6. Set the returned value as the right child of the current node.
    - **`createArrBalBST(arr, 4, 6)`** is called.
        - Check if start index 4 is greater than end index 6. It is not, so continue.
        - Calculate the middle index as (4 + 6) / 2 = 5.
        - Create a new node with the value at the middle index (arr[5] = 6) as the data.
        - Recursively call **`createArrBalBST`** on the left subarray from the start index 4 to the middle index - 1 = 4. Set the returned value as the left child of the current node.
            - **`createArrBalBST(arr, 4, 4)`** is called.
                - Check if start index 4 is greater than end index 4. It is not, so continue.
                - Calculate the middle index as (4 + 4) / 2 = 4.
                - Create a new node with the value at the middle index (arr[4] = 5) as the data.
                - Return the current node.
            - The left child of the current node is set to the node returned from the previous step.
        - Recursively call **`createArrBalBST`** on the right subarray from the middle index + 1 = 6 to the end index 6. Set the returned value as the right child of the current node.
            - **`createArrBalBST(arr, 6, 6)`** is called.
                - Check if start index 6 is greater than end index 6. It is not, so continue.
                - Calculate the middle index as (6 + 6) / 2 = 6.
                - Create a new node with the value at the middle index (arr[6] = 7) as the data.
                - Return the current node.
            - The right child of the current node is set to the node returned from the previous step.
        - Return the current node.
    - The right child of the current node is set to the node returned from the previous step.
6. Return the current node.

The resulting balanced BST is as follows:

```

       4
     /   \
    2     6
   / \   / \
  1   3 5   7
```

**Problem Statement:**
The problem is to convert a given Binary Search Tree (BST) into a balanced BST. A balanced BST is a binary tree in which the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1.

**Examples:**
Input:

```

     8
   /   \
  6    10
 /      \
5       11
         \
         12
```

Output:

```

      10
    /    \
   6     11
 /  \      \
5    8      12
```

**Explanation:**
The input BST is unbalanced, as the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees of node 8 is 3. The goal is to convert this unbalanced BST into a balanced BST.

**Approach:**

1. Perform an in-order traversal of the given BST to obtain the sorted sequence of elements.
2. Construct a new balanced BST using the sorted sequence.
3. The middle element of the sorted sequence becomes the root of the new BST.
4. Recursively repeat steps 2 and 3 for the left and right halves of the sorted sequence, respectively.
5. Return the root of the new balanced BST.

**Pseudocode:**

```
public static Node bstToBalancedBST(Node root) {
    ArrayList<Integer> inOrder = new ArrayList<>();
    inOrderlevelSeq(root, inOrder);
    root = createBalBST(inOrder, 0, inOrder.size() - 1);
    return root;
}

public static void inOrderlevelSeq(Node root, ArrayList<Integer> sortedArray) {
    if (root == null) {
        return;
    }
    inOrderlevelSeq(root.left, sortedArray);
    sortedArray.add(root.data);
    inOrderlevelSeq(root.right, sortedArray);
}

public static Node createBalBST(ArrayList<Integer> arr, int start, int end) {
    if (start > end) {
        return null;
    }
    int mid = (start + end) / 2;
    Node root = new Node(arr.get(mid));
    root.left = createBalBST(arr, start, mid - 1);
    root.right = createBalBST(arr, mid + 1, end);
    return root;
}

```

**Dry Run:**
Given BST:

```

      8
    /   \
   6    10
  /      \
 5       11
          \
          12
```

1. The in-order traversal of the BST gives the sorted sequence: [5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12].
2. The middle element of the sorted sequence is 8, which becomes the root of the new balanced BST.
3. Recursively, for the left half [5, 6], the middle element is 6, which becomes the left child of the root.
4. Recursively, for the right half [10, 11, 12], the middle element is 11, which becomes the right child of the root.
5. For the left half [5, 6], the middle element is 5, which becomes the left child of the left subtree.
6. For the right half [10, 11, 12], the middle element is 12, which becomes the right child of the right subtree.
7. The resulting balanced BST:

```
markdownCopy code
      10
    /    \
   6     11
 /  \      \
5    8      12

```

**Note:** The **`preorder(root3)`** function call in the **`main`** method is not defined in the given code, so the result of the balanced BST is not printed.
