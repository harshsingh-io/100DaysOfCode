## Key Concepts

# Wildcard Matching | (DP-34)

**Problem Statement:** Wildcard Matching

We are given two strings ‘S1’ and ‘S2’. String S1 can have the following two special characters:

1. ‘?’ can be matched to a single character of S2.
2. ‘*’ can be matched to any sequence of characters of S2. (sequence can be of length zero or more).

We need to check whether strings S1 and S2 match or not.

Example:

### **Sample Input 1:**

```
3
?ay
ray
ab*cd
abdefcd
ab?d
abcc

```

### **Sample Output 1:**

```
True
True
False
```

### **Sample Input 2:**

```
1
ba*a?
baaabab

```

### **Sample Output 2:**

```
True
```

### **Intuition:**

For every index of string S1, we have different options to match that index with string S2. Therefore, we can think in terms of string matching path as we have done already in previous questions.

- Either the characters match already.
- Or, if there is a ‘?’, we can explicitly match a single character.
- For a ‘*’, the following figure explains the scenario.

**Explanation**

1. Base Case Initialization:
    - Set **`dp[0][0] = true`** since two empty strings match.
    - For **`i = 1`** to **`n`**, if **`S1.charAt(i-1)`** is '*', set **`dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0]`** since '*' can match an empty sequence as well.
    - For **`j = 1`** to **`m`**, set **`dp[0][j] = false`** since an empty string **`S1`** cannot match a non-empty string **`S2`**.
2. Iteration over Characters:
    - For each character **`S1.charAt(i-1)`** at index **`i`** in **`S1`** and each character **`S2.charAt(j-1)`** at index **`j`** in **`S2`**:
        - If **`S1.charAt(i-1)`** is equal to **`S2.charAt(j-1)`** or **`S1.charAt(i-1)`** is '?':
            - Set **`dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`** since the current characters match, and we need to check if the remaining substrings match.
            - Example: If **`S1`** is "a?" and **`S2`** is "ab", since 'a' matches 'a' and '?' can match 'b', we check if the remaining substrings "a" and "b" match.
        - Else if **`S1.charAt(i-1)`** is '*':
            - Set **`dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] || dp[i][j-1]`** since '*' can match either an empty sequence (dp[i-1][j]) or any sequence of characters (dp[i][j-1]).
            - Example: If **`S1`** is "a*" and **`S2`** is "ab", since '*' can match an empty sequence or 'b', we check if either "a" and "ab" match or "a*" and "a" match.
        - Otherwise, set **`dp[i][j] = false`** since the characters do not match.
            - Example: If **`S1`** is "ac" and **`S2`** is "ab", since 'c' does not match 'b', we set **`dp[i][j] = false`**.
3. Result:
    - After iterating over all characters of **`S1`** and **`S2`**, the value of **`dp[n][m]`** will represent whether the strings **`S1`** and **`S2`** match or not.
    - If **`dp[n][m]`** is **`true`**, it means that **`S1`** and **`S2`** match.
    - If **`dp[n][m]`** is **`false`**, it means that **`S1`** and **`S2`** do not match.

The **`wildcardMatching(S1, S2)`** function call will return the result of the wildcard matching, indicating whether the strings **`S1`** and **`S2`** match or not.

**Approach (Tabulation):**

1. Create a 2D boolean array **`dp`** of size **`(n + 1) × (m + 1)`**, where **`n`** is the length of string **`S1`** and **`m`** is the length of string **`S2`**.
    - **`dp[i][j]`** represents whether the substring of **`S1`** from index **`0`** to **`i-1`** matches the substring of **`S2`** from index **`0`** to **`j-1`**.
2. Initialize the base cases:
    - Set **`dp[0][0] = true`** since two empty strings match.
    - For **`i = 1`** to **`n`**, if **`S1.charAt(i-1)`** is '*', set **`dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0]`** since '*' can match an empty sequence as well.
    - For **`j = 1`** to **`m`**, set **`dp[0][j] = false`** since an empty string **`S1`** cannot match a non-empty string **`S2`**.
3. Iterate over the characters of **`S1`** and **`S2`** using two nested loops:
    - For each character **`S1.charAt(i-1)`** at index **`i`** in **`S1`** and each character **`S2.charAt(j-1)`** at index **`j`** in **`S2`**:
        - If **`S1.charAt(i-1)`** is equal to **`S2.charAt(j-1)`** or **`S1.charAt(i-1)`** is '?':
            - Set **`dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`** since the current characters match, and we need to check if the remaining substrings match.
        - Else if **`S1.charAt(i-1)`** is '*':
            - Set **`dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] || dp[i][j-1]`** since '*' can match either an empty sequence (dp[i-1][j]) or any sequence of characters (dp[i][j-1]).
        - Otherwise, set **`dp[i][j] = false`** since the characters do not match.
    - Repeat this process for all values of **`i`** and **`j`**.
4. After iterating over all characters of **`S1`** and **`S2`**, the value of **`dp[n][m]`** will represent whether the strings **`S1`** and **`S2`** match or not.
5. Return the value of **`dp[n][m]`**.
