## Key Concepts

### LOWEST COMMON ANCESTOR(LCA) - APPRAOCH-1

# **Problem Statement:**

Given a binary tree and two nodes, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the two nodes.

# **Example:**

```
markdownCopy code
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \   \
    4   5   6
             \
              7

```

LCA of nodes 4 and 5: 2

# **Explanation:**

The lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree is the deepest node that is a common ancestor of both nodes. In the given example, the LCA of nodes 4 and 5 is node 2.

# **Approach:**

To find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes, we can follow these steps:

1. Start from the root node and find the paths from the root to both nodes using a recursive function **`getPath`**.
2. **`getPath`** function:
    - If the current node is null, return false to indicate that the node is not found.
    - Add the current node to the path.
    - If the current node's data is equal to the target node's data, return true to indicate that the node is found.
    - Recursively call **`getPath`** on the left and right subtrees.
    - If either the left or right subtree returns true, it means the node is found in either subtree, so return true.
    - If none of the above conditions are met, remove the current node from the path and return false.
3. Create two ArrayLists, **`path1`** and **`path2`**, to store the paths from the root to the two nodes.
4. Call **`getPath`** with the root, node1, and **`path1`** to find the path from the root to node1.
5. Call **`getPath`** with the root, node2, and **`path2`** to find the path from the root to node2.
6. Iterate through both paths simultaneously until a mismatch is found.
7. The last common node before the mismatch is the lowest common ancestor (LCA).
8. Return the LCA.

# **Pseudocode:**

```
kotlinCopy code
getPath(root, n, path):
    if root is null:
        return false

    add root to path
    if root.data is equal to n:
        return true

    foundLeftPath = getPath(root.left, n, path)
    foundRightPath = getPath(root.right, n, path)

    if foundLeftPath or foundRightPath:
        return true

    remove the last node from path
    return false

lca(root, n1, n2):
    path1 = new ArrayList<Node>()
    path2 = new ArrayList<Node>()

    getPath(root, n1, path1)
    getPath(root, n2, path2)

    i = 0
    while i is less than path1.size() and i is less than path2.size():
        if path1.get(i) is not equal to path2.get(i):
            break
        i = i + 1

    lca = path1.get(i - 1)
    return lca

```

# **Dry Run:**

Given binary tree:

```
markdownCopy code
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \   \
    4   5   6
             \
              7

```

Finding LCA of nodes 4 and 5.

1. Initialize **`path1`** and **`path2`** ArrayLists.
2. Call **`getPath`** with root, 4, and **`path1`**.
    - Add 1 to **`path1`**.
    - Call **`getPath`** with 2 (left child of root), 4, and **`path1`**.
        - Add 2 to **`path1`**.
        - Call **`getPath`** with 4 (left child of 2), 4, and **`path1`**.
            - Add 4 to **`path1`**.
            - 4 is found, so return true.
        - Left subtree of 2 returns true, so return true.
    - Left subtree of root returns true, so return true.
3. Call **`getPath`** with root, 5, and **`path2`**.
    - Add 1 to **`path2`**.
    - Call **`getPath`** with 2 (left child of root), 5, and **`path2`**.
        - Add 2 to **`path2`**.
        - Call **`getPath`** with 4 (left child of 2), 5, and **`path2`**.
            - Add 4 to **`path2`**.
            - 5 is not found in the left subtree of 4, so return false.
        - Call **`getPath`** with 5 (right child of 2), 5, and **`path2`**.
            - Add 5 to **`path2`**.
            - 5 is found, so return true.
        - Right subtree of 2 returns true, so return true.
    - Right subtree of root returns true, so return true.
4. Iterate from i = 0 to i = 2 (common size of **`path1`** and **`path2`**).
    - At i = 0, path1.get(0) (1) is equal to path2.get(0) (1).
    - At i = 1, path1.get(1) (2) is equal to path2.get(1) (2).
    - At i = 2, path1.get(2) (4) is not equal to path2.get(2) (5).
5. The last common node before the mismatch is path1.get(2 - 1) (2).
6. Return node 2 as the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 4 and 5.

The lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 4 and 5 is node 2.

```java
public static boolean getPath(Node root, int n, ArrayList<Node> path) {
        if (root == null) {
            return false;
        }

        path.add(root);
        if (root.data == n) {
            return true;
        }

        boolean foundleftPath = getPath(root.left, n, path);
        boolean foundrightPath = getPath(root.right, n, path);

        if (foundrightPath || foundleftPath) {
            return true;
        }

        path.remove(path.size() - 1);
        return false;
    }

    public static Node lca(Node root, int n1, int n2) { //O(N) sc)(n)
        ArrayList<Node> path1 = new ArrayList<>();
        ArrayList<Node> path2 = new ArrayList<>();

        getPath(root, n1, path1);
        getPath(root, n2, path2);

//        last common ancestor
        int i = 0; // put outside the loop to use further in Node lca
        for (; i < path1.size() && i < path2.size(); i++) {
            if (path1.get(i) != path2.get(i)) {
                break;
            }
        }
        Node lca = path1.get(i - 1);
        return lca;
    }
```
