## What I Learned Today

Explaination Of Longest Common Subsequences.

Recursive Approach

## Key Concepts

The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is a classic problem in computer science that aims to find the longest subsequence that is present in two given strings. A subsequence is a sequence of characters that can be derived from a string by deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

For example, given the strings "ABCDGH" and "AEDFHR", the longest common subsequence is "ADH", with a length of 3.

Recursive approach:The LCS problem can be solved recursively using dynamic programming. The recursive approach involves breaking down the problem into subproblems of smaller sizes and then combining their solutions to solve the original problem. Here's how the recursive approach works:

1. If one or both of the strings are empty, then the LCS is 0.

2. If the last characters of the strings match, then the LCS is 1 plus the LCS of the remaining strings.

3. If the last characters of the strings do not match, then the LCS is the maximum of the LCS of the first string and the second string with their last characters removed.

Implementation:The recursive approach can be implemented using a recursive function that takes two strings and their lengths as inputs. The function returns the length of the LCS of the two strings.
