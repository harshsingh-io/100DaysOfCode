## Key Concepts

Catalan's Number Problem is a classic problem in combinatorics that involves finding the number of unique binary trees that can be formed with **`n`** nodes. The solution to the problem is given by the Catalan number **`C(n)`**, which is defined as:

```
C(n) = (2n)! / (n! * (n+1)!)
```

The recursive formula for calculating **`C(n)`** is given by:

```
C(n) = Summation(C(i)*C(n-i-1)), where i ranges from 0 to n-1
```

This formula states that the **`n`**th Catalan number can be computed by summing up the product of the **`i`**th Catalan number and the **`(n-i-1)`**th Catalan number, where **`i`** ranges from 0 to **`n-1`**.

Here are the steps to solve the Catalan's Number Problem using the recursion approach:

1. Define a function **`catalan(n)`** that takes an input integer **`n`** representing the number of nodes in the binary tree.
2. If **`n`** is 0 or 1, return 1, since there is only one unique binary tree that can be formed with 0 or 1 nodes.
3. Initialize a variable **`result`** to 0.
4. Use a loop to iterate from 0 to **`n-1`**.
5. Recursively compute the **`i`**th Catalan number and the **`(n-i-1)`**th Catalan number.
6. Multiply the two computed Catalan numbers together.
7. Add the result of step 6 to the **`result`** variable.
8. Return the **`result`** variable as the **`n`**th Catalan number.
9. Call the **`catalan`** function with the desired input value of **`n`** to compute the corresponding Catalan number.
10. The computed value of the Catalan number represents the number of unique binary trees that can be formed with **`n`** nodes.

Here's the pseudocode for the above approach:

```
function catalan(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        result = 0
        for i from 0 to n-1:
            result += catalan(i) * catalan(n-i-1)
        return result
```

Here's the recursion tree for **`n=4`**:

```

                                         catalan(4)
                          /                  |                  \
                  catalan(0)         catalan(3)           catalan(2)
                                          /    \              /     \
                                   catalan(0)  catalan(2)  catalan(0)  catalan(1)
                                                        /    \          /    \
                                                 catalan(0) catalan(1) catalan(0) catalan(1)
                                                                   /   \         /   \
                                                             catalan(0) catalan(0) catalan(0) catalan(0)
```

As you can see, the number of unique function calls grows rapidly as **`n`** increases. In fact, for **`n=4`**, we already have 14 unique function calls. If we were to use the recursive approach to compute **`catalan(50)`**, we would end up with an astronomical number of function calls, which would make the algorithm very slow.

By using dynamic programming, we can avoid these redundant function calls and greatly speed up the algorithm. Instead of recomputing the same values over and over again, we can simply look them up in a table and reuse them. This reduces the time complexity of the algorithm from exponential to polynomial, making it feasible for larger values of **`n`**.

## Code Snippets

```java
public class CatalanNumber {
    public static int catalan(int n){
        if (n==0||n==1) return 1;
        int ans=0;
        for (int i=0; i<n;i++){
            ans+= catalan(i)*catalan(n-i-1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(catalan(4));
    }
}
```
