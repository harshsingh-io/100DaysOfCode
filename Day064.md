## Key Concepts

### LOWEST COMMON ANCESTOR(LCA) - APPRAOCH-2

# **Problem Statement:**

Given a binary tree and two nodes, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the two nodes.

# **Example:**

```
markdownCopy code
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \   \
    4   5   6
             \
              7

```

LCA of nodes 4 and 5: 2

# **Explanation:**

The lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree is the deepest node that is a common ancestor of both nodes. In the given example, the LCA of nodes 4 and 5 is node 2.

# **Approach:**

To find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes with O(1) space complexity, we can follow these steps:

1. If the current node is null or the current node's data matches either of the target nodes' data, return the current node.
2. Recursively call **`lca2`** on the left and right subtrees.
3. If the left LCA is null, return the right LCA.
4. If the right LCA is null, return the left LCA.
5. If both the left and right LCA are not null, it means the target nodes are present in different subtrees, so the current node is the LCA.
6. Return the current node.

# **Pseudocode:**

```
kotlinCopy code
lca2(root, n1, n2):
    if root is null or root.data is equal to n1 or root.data is equal to n2:
        return root

    leftLca = lca2(root.left, n1, n2)
    rightLca = lca2(root.right, n1, n2)

    if rightLca is null:
        return leftLca

    if leftLca is null:
        return rightLca

    return root

```

# **Dry Run:**

Given binary tree:

```
markdownCopy code
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \   \
    4   5   6
             \
              7

```

Finding LCA of nodes 4 and 5.

1. Check if the current node (1) is null or matches either of the target nodes (4 or 5). None of the conditions are met.
2. Recursively call **`lca2`** on the left subtree (2, 4, 5).
    - Check if the current node (2) is null or matches either of the target nodes (4 or 5). None of the conditions are met.
    - Recursively call **`lca2`** on the left subtree (4, 4, 5).
        - Check if the current node (4) is null or matches either of the target nodes (4 or 5). The current node matches n1 (4).
        - Return node 4.
    - Recursively call **`lca2`** on the right subtree (5, 4, 5).
        - Check if the current node (5) is null or matches either of the target nodes (4 or 5). The current node matches n2 (5).
        - Return node 5.
    - The left LCA is node 4, and the right LCA is node 5.
    - Return node 2.
3. Check if the left LCA is null. It is not null, so continue.
4. Check if the right LCA is null. It is not null, so continue.
5. Since both the left and right LCA are not null, the current node (1) is the LCA.
6. Return node 1 as the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 4 and 5.

The lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 4 and 5 is node 1.

## Code Snippets

```java
public static Node lca2(Node root, int n1, int n2) {// Tc O(N) sc O(1)
        if (root == null || root.data == n1 || root.data == n2) {
            return root;
        }
        Node leftLca = lca2(root.left, n1, n2);
        Node rightLca = lca2(root.right, n1, n2);

        // leftLca = value and rightLca = null
        if (rightLca == null) {
            return leftLca;
        }
        // leftLca = null and rightLca = value

        if (leftLca == null) {
            return rightLca;
        }
//        if 1 value of 'n' is in leftSubtree(leftLca) and 1 is in rightSubtree(rightLca) the root itself is LCA
        return root;
    }
```
