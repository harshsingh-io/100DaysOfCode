## Key Concepts

### MATRIX CHAIN MULTIPLICATION

Matrix Chain Multiplication is a classic problem in dynamic programming where given a sequence of matrices, we have to find the minimum number of multiplication operations required to multiply all the matrices. The problem involves finding the optimal order in which to perform the matrix multiplications.

One approach to solve the Matrix Chain Multiplication problem is the memoization approach, also known as the top-down approach. In this approach, we break down the problem into smaller subproblems and store the solutions of these subproblems in a table (also known as a memo table or cache) so that we do not have to recompute them again. This technique reduces the overall time complexity of the algorithm.

The memoization approach for solving the matrix chain multiplication problem involves storing the intermediate results in a table, so that they can be reused when needed, rather than recomputing them.

Here is the step-by-step implementation of the memoization approach for the matrix chain multiplication problem:

1. Create a 2D table of size n x n, where n is the number of matrices.
2. Initialize the table with -1 to indicate that no value has been computed yet.
3. Define a recursive function **`matrixChainMemoized`** that takes in the matrices array, the table, the start index **`i`**, and the end index **`j`**.
4. In the function, check if the value at table[i][j] is not -1. If it is not, return the value.
5. If i and j are equal, return 0 as the cost to multiply a single matrix is zero.
6. Set the minimum cost to infinity.
7. Loop through k from i to j-1:
a. Compute the cost of multiplying the matrices from i to k using the function recursively. Store the result in variable **`leftCost`**.
b. Compute the cost of multiplying the matrices from k+1 to j using the function recursively. Store the result in variable **`rightCost`**.
c. Compute the cost of multiplying the two matrices obtained from the above steps and store it in variable **`totalCost`**.
d. Update the minimum cost if the **`totalCost`** is less than the current minimum cost.
8. Store the minimum cost in the table at index i,j.
9. Return the minimum cost.

The above approach uses memoization to store the intermediate results, so that they can be reused in future calculations. This approach significantly reduces the number of calculations needed, improving the time complexity of the algorithm.

Here's the pseudocode for the memoization approach in language-independent format:

```
function matrixChainMemoized(matrices, table, i, j):
    if table[i][j] is not -1:
        return table[i][j]
    if i == j:
        return 0
    minCost = infinity
    for k from i to j-1:
        leftCost = matrixChainMemoized(matrices, table, i, k)
        rightCost = matrixChainMemoized(matrices, table, k+1, j)
        totalCost = leftCost + rightCost + (matrices[i][0] * matrices[k][1] * matrices[j][1])
        if totalCost < minCost:
            minCost = totalCost
    table[i][j] = minCost
    return minCost
```

Overall, the memoization approach provides an efficient solution for the matrix chain multiplication problem. By storing the intermediate results in a table and reusing them when needed, we can significantly reduce the number of computations required, resulting in a faster algorithm.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MatrixChainMultiplication {
    public static int mcm(int[] arr, int i, int j) {
        if (i == j) return 0; //single matrix cost/case
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int k = i; k < j; k++) {
            int cost1 = mcm(arr, i, k); //Ai...Ak => arr[i-1}*arr[k]
            int cost2 = mcm(arr, k + 1, j); //Ai+1...Aj => arr[k]*arr[j]
            int cost3 = arr[i - 1] * arr[k] * arr[j];
            int finalCost = cost1 + cost2 + cost3;
            ans = Math.min(ans, finalCost);
        }
        return ans;
    }

    public static int mcmMemoization(int[] arr, int[][] dp, int i, int j) {
        if (i == j) return 0; //single matrix cost/case
        if (dp[i][j] != -1) {
            return dp[i][j];
        }
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int k = i; k < j; k++) {
            int cost1 = mcm(arr, i, k); //Ai...Ak => arr[i-1}*arr[k]
            int cost2 = mcm(arr, k + 1, j); //Ai+1...Aj => arr[k]*arr[j]
            int cost3 = arr[i - 1] * arr[k] * arr[j];
            int finalCost = cost1 + cost2 + cost3;
            ans = Math.min(ans, finalCost);
        }
        return dp[i][j] = ans;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 3};
        int n = arr.length;
        System.out.println(mcm(arr, 1, n - 1));
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = -1;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(mcmMemoization(arr, dp, 1, n - 1));

    }
