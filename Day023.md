## Key Concepts

### Majority Element Problem

**Problem statement:**

Given an array of integers, find the majority element, which appears more than half of the time in the array. If there is no majority element, return **`None`**.

Example:

Input: **`[3, 2, 3]`**

Output: **`3`**

Explanation: **`3`** appears twice in the array, which is more than half the length of the array, so it is the majority element.

---

Input: **`[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`**

Output: **`2`**

Explanation: **`2`** appears four times in the array, which is more than half the length of the array, so it is the majority element.

---

Input: **`[1, 2, 3, 4]`**

Output: **`None`**

Explanation: There is no element in the array that appears more than half the time, so the function returns **`None`**.

Test cases:

Input: **`[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`**

Output: **`1`**

---

Input: **`[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`**

Output: **`3`**

---

Input: **`[5, 5, 5, 5]`**

Output: **`5`**

---

Input: **`[]`**

Output: **`None`**

---

Input: **`[1]`**

Output: **`1`**

**Approach to solving this problem is by using a HashMap.**

The idea behind using a hashmap is to keep track of the count of each element in the array. We can loop through the array, and for each element, we can check if it already exists in the hashmap. If it does, we can increment the count. If it doesn't, we can add it to the hashmap with a count of 1.

Once we have the count of each element in the array, we can loop through the hashmap and find the element with the highest count. If the count of this element is greater than half the length of the array, then we have found the majority element.

**Implementation Steps :**

The implementation steps for solving the majority element problem using a hashmap are as follows:

1. Initialize an empty hashmap to keep track of the count of each element in the array.
2. Loop through the array of integers and for each element, check if it exists in the hashmap. If it does, increment its count. If it doesn't, add it to the hashmap with a count of 1.
3. Loop through the hashmap to find the element with the highest count.
4. Check if the count of this element is greater than half the length of the array. If it is, then we have found the majority element.
5. Return the majority element if it exists, otherwise return **`Null`**.

### Valid Anagram Problem(Easy)

**Problem statement:**

Given two strings **`s`** and **`t`**, write a function **`isAnagram(s, t)`** that returns **`True`** if **`t`** is an anagram of **`s`**, and **`False`** otherwise.

Note:

You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase alphabets.

Examples:

Input: **`s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"`**

Output: **`True`**

Explanation: The two strings have the same characters and frequency of characters, so they are anagrams of each other.

---

Input: **`s = "rat", t = "car"`**

Output: **`False`**

Explanation: The two strings have different characters, so they are not anagrams of each other.

---

Input: **`s = "", t = ""`**

Output: **`True`**

Explanation: Both strings are empty, so they are anagrams of each other.

Test Cases:

Input: **`s = "listen", t = "silent"`**

Output: **`True`**

---

Input: **`s = "abc", t = "def"`**

Output: **`False`**

---

Input: **`s = "anagram", t = "anagram"`**

Output: **`True`**

---

Input: **`s = "abcd", t = "dcba"`**

Output: **`True`**

---

Input: **`s = "", t = "a"`**

Output: **`False`**

**Approach to solving this problem is by using a HashMap.**

We start by initializing two empty dictionaries **`dict1`** and **`dict2`** to store the frequency of each character in both strings. We then traverse through both strings and for each character, we check if it is already present in **`dict1`** and **`dict2`**. If it is not present, we add it to the dictionary and set its count to 1. If it is already present, we simply increment its count by 1. Finally, we compare both dictionaries, and if they are equal, we return True (i.e., the strings are anagrams), otherwise, we return False (i.e., the strings are not anagrams).

**Implementation Steps :**

1. Initialize two empty dictionaries **`dict1`** and **`dict2`**.
2. Traverse through the characters of both strings, and for each character:
    - If the character is not in **`dict1`**, add it to **`dict1`** and set its count to 1.
    - If the character is already in **`dict1`**, increment its count by 1.
    - Repeat the above two steps for **`dict2`**.
3. Compare both dictionaries. If they are equal, return True, otherwise return False.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MajorityElement {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 3, 2, 5, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1};
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
//            if (map.containsKey(arr[i])) {
//                map.put(arr[i], map.get(arr[i]) + 1);
//            } else {
//                map.put(arr[i], 1);
//            }
            //short form of above if else condition

            map.put(arr[i], map.getOrDefault(arr[i], 0) + 1);
        }
//        Set<Integer> keySet = map.keySet();
        for (Integer key : map.keySet()) {
            if (map.get(key) > arr.length / 3) {
                System.out.println(key);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class ValidAnagram {
    static boolean validAnagram(String s, String t) {
        HashMap<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
//            if (map.containsKey(arr[i])) {
//                map.put(arr[i], map.get(arr[i]) + 1);
//            } else {
//                map.put(arr[i], 1);
//            }
            //short form of above if else condition

            map.put(s.charAt(i), map.getOrDefault(s.charAt(i), 0) + 1);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < t.length(); i++) {
            Character ch = t.charAt(i);
            if (map.containsKey(ch)) {
                if (map.get(ch) == 1) {
                    map.remove(ch);
                } else {
                    map.put(ch, map.get(ch) - 1);
                }
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return map.isEmpty();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "knee";
        String t = "keen";
        System.out.println(validAnagram(s, t));
