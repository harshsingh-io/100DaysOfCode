## Key Concepts

**QUERY OPERATION IN SEGMENT TREE**

- The query operation in a segment tree is used to find the **max/min element** in a **subarray** of the given array.
- To perform this operation, we start at the **root node** of the segment tree and check if the range of the node overlaps with the query range.
- There are three types of overlap: **non-overlapping**, **complete overlap**, and **partial overlap**.
- If the ranges do not overlap, we simply return **0** as there are no values to consider.
- If the range of the node is completely inside the query range, we return the **max/min value** of the node.
- If the range of the node partially overlaps with the query range, we **recurse** on both the left and right child of the node.
- The **mid-point** of the range is used to split the node into two sub-nodes.
- We perform the query operation recursively on the sub-nodes until we reach the leaf nodes of the segment tree.
- Finally, we return the **max/min value** obtained from the leaf nodes.

Key Points:

- Query operation in segment tree is used to find max/min element in subarray of the given array.
- Three types of overlap - non-overlapping, complete overlap, and partial overlap.
- Recurse on left and right child of node when there is partial overlap.
- Mid-point is used to split node into two sub-nodes.
- Query operation is performed recursively on the sub-nodes until we reach the leaf nodes.
- Max/min value is returned from the leaf nodes.

Pseudocode:

Here's the pseudocode for the query operation to get the maximum element in a subarray using a segment tree:

```
function getMaxUtil(i, si, sj, qi, qj):
    if qj < si or qi > sj:
        return -infinity //non-overlapping case
    else if si >= qi and sj <= qj:
        return tree[i] //complete overlap case
    else:
        mid = (si + sj) / 2
        left = getMaxUtil(2 * i + 1, si, mid, qi, qj)
        right = getMaxUtil(2 * i + 2, mid + 1, sj, qi, qj)
        return max(left, right) //partial overlap case

function getMax(arr, qi, qj):
    n = arr.length
    return getMaxUtil(0, 0, n - 1, qi, qj)

```

Now, let me explain the code that provided:

The **`getMaxUtil`** function is a recursive function that returns the maximum value in the range **`[qi, qj]`** for the node at index **`i`** in the segment tree with bounds **`[si, sj]`**. There are three cases to consider:

1. Non-overlapping case: If the range **`[qi, qj]`** is completely outside the range **`[si, sj]`**, then return the minimum integer value as there is no overlap and thus no value to return.
2. Complete overlapping case: If the range **`[qi, qj]`** is completely inside the range **`[si, sj]`**, then return the value at the node **`i`** in the segment tree as it holds the maximum value in this range.
3. Partial overlapping case: If the range **`[qi, qj]`** partially overlaps with **`[si, sj]`**, then recursively call **`getMaxUtil`** on the left and right subtrees and return the maximum of the two values.

The **`getMax`** function simply initializes the segment tree and calls **`getMaxUtil`** with the root node index and the bounds of the array **`arr`**.

In terms of variables, **`i`** represents the current node index, **`si`** and **`sj`** represent the bounds of the range for the current node, **`qi`** and **`qj`** represent the query range that we are interested in, **`mid`** represents the midpoint of the current node range, and **`left`** and **`right`** represent the maximum values returned by the recursive calls to the left and right subtrees, respectively.

The **`Math.max`** function is used to get the maximum value between the left and right subtree maximum values.

Overall, the **`getMax`** operation takes O(log n) time complexity, as the maximum number of nodes.

**Update operation in Segment Tree:**

- The update operation is used to modify the value of an element in the input array.
- We need to update the corresponding value in the segment tree as well, to reflect the change in the input array.
- The update operation involves traversing the segment tree from the root to the leaves, and updating the values of the nodes that correspond to the input array element being modified.
- We use a recursive approach to perform the update operation.
- The update operation is performed on the tree rooted at node i, which corresponds to the range [si, sj] of the input array.
- If the input array index is outside the range of the node, then we return without making any changes.
- If the input array index is within the range of the node, we update the value of the node and proceed to its child nodes.
- We continue the recursive update operation on the child nodes until we reach the leaf node that corresponds to the input array element being modified.

Pseudocode:

```
function updateUtil(i, si, sj, idx, diff):
    if idx < si or idx > sj:
        return
    tree[i] += diff
    if si != sj:
        mid = (si + sj) / 2
        updateUtil(2 * i + 1, si, mid, idx, diff)
        updateUtil(2 * i + 2, mid + 1, sj, idx, diff)

function update(arr, idx, newVal):
    diff = newVal - arr[idx]
    arr[idx] = newVal
    updateUtil(0, 0, n-1, idx, diff)

```

Explanation:

- The **`updateUtil`** function takes as input the node index **`i`**, the range **`[si, sj]`** of the input array that the node corresponds to, the index **`idx`** of the element being updated in the input array, and the difference **`diff`** between the new and old values of the element.
- If the input array index **`idx`** is outside the range of the node **`[si, sj]`**, then we return without making any changes to the node.
- If the input array index **`idx`** is within the range of the node **`[si, sj]`**, we update the value of the node by adding the difference **`diff`** to it.
- If the node is not a leaf node, we recursively update its child nodes by calling the **`updateUtil`** function on them.
- The **`update`** function takes as input the input array **`arr`**, the index **`idx`** of the element being updated, and the new value **`newVal`** of the element.
- It computes the difference **`diff`** between the new and old values of the element, and updates the input array **`arr`** with the new value.
- It then calls the **`updateUtil`** function with the root node index 0, the range **`[0, n-1]`** of the input array, the index **`idx`** of the element being updated, and the difference **`diff`** between the new and old values of the element.
- This recursively updates the segment tree to reflect the change in the input array.
