## Key Concepts

**Problem Statement:**
The problem is to find the number of possible ways to reach the bottom-right cell of a grid starting from the top-left cell. You can only move either right or down at each step.

**Example:**
Grid:

```

[1, 2, 3]
[4, 5, 6]
[7, 8, 9]
```

Output:

```
Number of ways: 6
```

**Explanation:**
The grid represents a 3x3 matrix with the numbers from 1 to 9. The top-left cell is 1, and the bottom-right cell is 9. The goal is to find the number of possible ways to reach cell 9 from cell 1 by moving either right or down at each step.

**Approach:**

1. The base case is defined when the current cell is the bottom-right cell. In that case, return 1 to indicate a successful path.
2. If the current cell goes beyond the boundaries of the grid (i.e., **`i`** is equal to **`n`** or **`j`** is equal to **`m`**), return 0 to indicate an unsuccessful path.
3. Recursively, calculate the number of ways by moving one step down (**`i+1, j`**) and add it to the number of ways by moving one step right (**`i, j+1`**).
4. Return the sum of the above two values, which represents the total number of ways.

**Pseudocode:**

```
public static int gridWays(int i, int j, int n, int m) {
    // Base case
    if (i == n - 1 && j == m - 1) {
        return 1;
    } else if (i == n || j == m) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Recursive calculation
    int w1 = gridWays(i + 1, j, n, m); // Move down
    int w2 = gridWays(i, j + 1, n, m); // Move right
    return w1 + w2;
}
```

**Dry Run:**
Given grid:

```
[1, 2, 3]
[4, 5, 6]
[7, 8, 9]
```

1. Starting from the top-left cell (1), we recursively calculate the number of ways to reach the bottom-right cell (9).
2. At each step, we have two choices: move down or move right.
3. For the cell at position (0, 0), we can either move down to (1, 0) or move right to (0, 1).
4. From (1, 0), we can again choose to move down to (2, 0) or move right to (1, 1).
5. From (0, 1), we can only move right to (0, 2).
6. Continuing this process, we calculate the number of ways for each cell until we reach the bottom-right cell (9).
7. The total number of ways to reach cell 9 is 6.

**Note:**
The **`gridWays(0, 0, n, m)`** function call in the **`main`** method is used to calculate and print the number of ways to reach the bottom-right cell of a grid of size **`n x m`**.

## Code Snippets

```java
public static int gridWays(int i, int j, int n, int m) {
        //base case
        if (i == n - 1 && j == m - 1) { // condition for last cell
            return 1;
        } else if (i == n || j == n) { //boundary cross condition
            return 0;
        }

        int w1 = gridWays(i + 1, j, n, m);
        int w2 = gridWays(i, j + 1, n, m);
        return w1 + w2;
    }
```
