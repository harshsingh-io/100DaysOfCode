## What I Learned Today

Implementation Of Hashmap

How Key value takes O(1) time complexity in insertion operation.

Concept of Rehashing

Threshold Value in HashMap

## Key Concepts

Here the capacity(maximum size of HashMap) is calculated in the way that it is always the power of 2.

Now 2 cases can rise while inserting the key-value pair.

**case 1**. The key (of the Node to insert) is null

If the key is null, the table iterates over the first table index(**null Node is always inserted at index 0**) to find if there is any null key present already. If there already is a null present the replace its value with the new value, and return the old value.

If there was no Node with the null key already inserted, then insert this Node at 0 indexes.As it is to be inserted at 0th Index, the hash will be 0 and index = 0.

***Note:** We can not calculate the hash of the null Node, so the hashcode of null Node is taken as 0.*As the Node is inserted the first time, return null, signifying that there was no Node will null key inserted before.

> Note: put() method inserts the Node and returns the previous value if the Node with same Key already existed before. If it is being inserted for the first time then it returns null.
> 

*How the Node is added will be discussed later.*

**case 2**. The key(of the Node to insert) is non-null

In case the key of the Node to be inserted is not null, calculate the following:*a. hashcode for the keyb. index to place the Node at*The index is calculated from hashcode and the current length of the table so that the index is always within the array length.Now iterate at the table[index] to check if there already is the Node with same key present or not.

So it iterates at table[i] where (i= index calculated at step: b) and checks if there is the node already present.If the Node is present, its value is replaced and the old value is returned, as done will null case(when there was already Node with the null key present).

> NOTE: To check for equality of 2 nodes, both the hashcode and equals come into picture, as observable from the code above.To compare the 2 Nodes, it checks whether their hashcodes are equal, and whether their equals also returns true.So for any object to be treated as the key for the hashmap, we must override the hashcode and the equals method in that object, so that they can be checked against the equality efficiently.

And if there was no such key found, then add the new Node into the hashmap.

**Adding the Nodes into hashmap**:To add the Node, we need its hashcode, index, key, and value.For Node will null key- **the key, hash, index are all 0**, and value as provided.For the non-null key node, the hash and index are calculated, and key and value as provided.While adding the new Node, we check if the current size of the Hashmap is more than the threshold value or not.

> Threshold has the value which is loadfactor*capacityCapacity is the maximum size of the HashMap

> ***float thresholdFloat = capacity * loadFactor;if (thresholdFloat > MAXIMUM_CAPACITY + 1) {thresholdFloat = MAXIMUM_CAPACITY + 1;}threshold = (int) thresholdFloat;***

> *So the threshold means if the current size exceeds this value, then the HashMap needs to be resized.Now threshold is 0.75*capacity i.e. if the current of the hashmap is more than 0.75 of the total size set, then resize it.Also we can set the loadFactor, but its default value is 0.75*
> 

So if the size exceeds the threshold then resize the hashmap.In resizing it, calculate the new capacity and copy all the Nodes to the new capacity hashmap.**Note:** the new size of the HashMap is double the previous size.

> Why we need to resize the HashMap?Its because if the size is fixed and as more and more elements are added to the hashmap, then there will be more and more collisions and hence longer linkedlists maintained, hence iterating over them will not be with constant time anymore but may go upto O(n). So to spread the Nodes more evenly, resize the hashmap once the total number of nodes in it exceeds some threshold value.
> 

So to resize:

new Hashmap with new capacity (= double the previous capacity) is created, the table now points to it, and the new threshold is created.Finally, the old elements are transferred to this new Hashmap as:

We iterate over every table index, at every index we iterate over all the elements of the LinkedList there.At every array index, the element found let be “e”
