## Key Concepts

0-1 Knapsack Problem:

- Items can either be included or excluded
- Each item can be used only once
- The goal is to maximize the total value of the items in the knapsack while keeping the total weight under the capacity of the knapsack
- The algorithm uses a two-dimensional table to store the maximum value that can be obtained for each weight and item

Unbounded Knapsack Problem:

- Items can be included any number of times
- Each item can be used multiple times
- The goal is to maximize the total value of the items in the knapsack while keeping the total weight under the capacity of the knapsack
- The algorithm uses a two-dimensional table to store the maximum value that can be obtained for each weight and item, but unlike 0-1 knapsack, it includes the current item again and again

Code Changes for Unbounded Knapsack:

- In 0-1 knapsack, the current item can be either included or excluded, so we use dp[i-1][j-w] to get the value if we include the current item. But in unbounded knapsack, we can include the current item again and again, so we use dp[i][j-w] to get the value if we include the current item.
- This is the only change required in the code to solve the unbounded knapsack problem.

Overall, the unbounded knapsack problem is a more generalized version of the 0-1 knapsack problem and requires a slight modification in the code to solve it.

### **0-1 Knapsack:**

### Initialization:

| i/j | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 15 | 15 | 15 | 15 | 15 | 15 |
| 2 | 0 | 0 | 15 | 15 | 15 | 29 | 29 | 29 |
| 3 | 0 | 10 | 15 | 25 | 25 | 29 | 39 | 40 |
| 4 | 0 | 10 | 15 | 45 | 55 | 60 | 70 | 75 |

Answer: 75

### Final output:

The maximum profit that can be obtained is 75.

### Pseudocode:

```
knapsackTabulation(val, wt, W):
    n = length(val)
    dp = [[0]*(W+1) for i in range(n+1)]

    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(1, W+1):
            if wt[i-1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = max(val[i-1] + dp[i-1][j-wt[i-1]], dp[i-1][j])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]

    return dp[n][W]

```

**Unbounded Knapsack:**

### Initialization:

| i/j | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 15 | 30 | 45 | 60 | 75 | 90 | 105 |
| 2 | 0 | 15 | 30 | 45 | 60 | 75 | 90 | 105 |
| 3 | 0 | 15 | 30 | 45 | 60 | 75 | 90 | 105 |
| 4 | 0 | 15 | 30 | 45 | 75 | 90 | 105 | 120 |

Answer: 100

### Final output:

The maximum profit that can be obtained is 100.

### Pseudocode:

```
unboundedKnapsackTabulation(val, wt, W):
    n = length(val)
    dp = [[0]*(W+1) for i in range(n+1)]
    
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(1, W+1):
            if wt[i-1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = max(val[i-1] + dp[i][j-wt[i-1]], dp[i-1][j])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
    
    return dp[n][W]
```

## Code Snippets

```java
public class UnboundedKnapsack {
    public static int unboundedKnapsackTabulation(int[] val, int[] wt, int W) {
        int n = val.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][W + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < dp.length; i++) { // 0th Column
            dp[i][0] = 0;
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < dp[0].length; j++) { // 0th Row
            dp[0][j] = 0;
        }
        //Tabulation LOOP
        for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < W + 1; j++) {
                int v = val[i - 1];
                int w = wt[i - 1];
                if (w <= j) { //Valid Condition
                    int includeProfit = v + dp[i][j - w]; //Here is the only change instead of i-1 we use i as we can include the current item again and again
                    int excludeProfit = dp[i - 1][j];
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(includeProfit, excludeProfit);
                } else { //Unvalid Condition
                    int excludeProfit = dp[i - 1][j];
                    dp[i][j] = excludeProfit;
                }
            }
        }
//        printDP(dp); // printing DP for Clarification
        return dp[n][W];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] val = {15, 14, 10, 45, 30};
        int[] wt = {2, 5, 1, 3, 4};
        int W = 7;
        System.out.println(unboundedKnapsackTabulation(val, wt, W));
    }
}
```
