‚Ä¢ Floyd Warshal Algorithm And Its Implementation

‚Ä¢ Max Area Of Island **8-Directional**

## Key Concepts

### Floyd Warshall Algorithm

The problem is to find the shortest distances between every pair of vertices in a given edge-weighted directed graph. The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix of size n*n. Matrix[i][j] denotes the weight of the edge from i to j. If Matrix[i][j]=-1, it means there is no edge from i to j.

Example : 

<aside>

üí° Input Format: matrix[][] = { {0, 2, -1, -1},  {1, 0, 3, -1},{-1, -1, 0, -1},{3, 5, 4, 0} }

Result:0 2 5 -1 1 0 3 -1 -1 -1 0 -1 3 5 4 0 

Explanation: In this example, the final matrix is storing the shortest distances. For example, matrix[i][j] is storing the shortest distance from node i to j.

### Maximum Area Of Island - 8-Directional

Approach #1: Depth-First Search (Recursive) 

Intuition and Algorithm :

We want to know the area of each connected shape in the grid, then take the maximum of these. If we are on a land square and explore every square connected to it 4-directionally (and recursively squares connected to those squares, and so on), then the total number of squares explored will be the area of that connected shape. To ensure we don't count squares in a shape more than once, let's use seen to keep track of squares we haven't visited before. It will also prevent us from counting the same shape more than once.
