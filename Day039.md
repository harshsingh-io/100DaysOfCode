## Key Concepts

**CATALAN’S NUMBER PROBLEM(TABULATION APPROACH)**

Catalan's Number Problem via tabulation approach:

1. Catalan's number is a sequence of numbers that appear in various counting problems, particularly those involving recursively defined objects.
2. The n-th Catalan number can be calculated using a formula that involves factorials and is given as: Cn = (2n!)/((n+1)!n!).
3. The tabulation approach to solve Catalan's number problem involves building a table of solutions for smaller sub-problems and using them to compute the solution to the larger problem.
4. To implement the tabulation approach, we start with the base case C0 = 1 and C1 = 1, and compute the solution for larger values of n iteratively by using the previously computed values.
5. The tabulation approach is more efficient than the recursive approach because it avoids repeated computations of the same sub-problems.
6. Here's the pseudocode for the tabulation approach to solve Catalan's number problem:

```
public int catalan(int n) {
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            dp[i] += dp[j] * dp[i - j - 1];
        }
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

In this code, we create an array **`dp`** of size **`n + 1`** to store the Catalan numbers. We set the initial value of **`dp[0]`** to 1, since the first Catalan number is 1.

Then we use a nested loop to fill in the values of **`dp`** for **`i`** ranging from 1 to **`n`**. For each **`i`**, we calculate **`dp[i]`** by summing over all possible values of **`j`** from 0 to **`i-1`**, where **`j`** represents the number of nodes in the left subtree of the root node in a Catalan binary tree of size **`i`**. The formula used to compute **`dp[i]`** is **`dp[i] += dp[j] * dp[i - j - 1]`**.

Finally, we return **`dp[n]`**, which represents the **`n`**-th Catalan number.

**Problem:** Given an integer **`n`**, count the number of possible Binary Search Trees (BSTs) that can be formed using numbers from **`1`** to **`n`**.

**Approach:** The Count BST problem can be solved using Catalan numbers. The nth Catalan number represents the count of unique BSTs that can be formed using **`n`** distinct nodes.

**Explanation:**

- A Binary Search Tree is a binary tree in which the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values in its left subtree and less than or equal to the values in its right subtree.
- To count the number of possible BSTs, we can form trees for each number from **`1`** to **`n`** as the root node, and then recursively count the number of left and right subtrees.
- The count of unique BSTs that can be formed using **`n`** distinct nodes is represented by the nth Catalan number, which can be calculated using the following formula:
    - Cn = (2n)! / ((n+1)! * n!)

**Implementation steps:**

1. Create an array **`count`** of size **`n+1`**, where **`count[i]`** represents the count of unique BSTs that can be formed using **`i`** distinct nodes.
2. Initialize **`count[0] = 1`**, as there is only one possible BST with 0 nodes.
3. Iterate from **`i=1`** to **`n`**, and for each value of **`i`**, iterate from **`j=1`** to **`i`**, and add the product of **`count[j-1]`** and **`count[i-j]`** to **`count[i]`**.
4. After completing the iteration, return **`count[n]`** as the count of unique BSTs that can be formed using **`n`** distinct nodes.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Function to calculate the count of unique BSTs for n nodes
public static int countBST(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        // if n is 0 or 1, there is only one unique BST possible
        return 1;
    }
    // Initialize an array to store Catalan numbers
    int[] catalan = new int[n+1];
    catalan[0] = catalan[1] = 1; // Base case
    // Calculate the Catalan numbers iteratively
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        catalan[i] = 0;
        // Calculate the Catalan number for i using the previous Catalan numbers
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            catalan[i] += catalan[j] * catalan[i-j-1];
        }
    }
    return catalan[n]; // Return the Catalan number for n
}
```

I hope this helps!
