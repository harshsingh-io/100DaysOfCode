## Key Concepts

### Rod-Cutting Problem(Dynamic Programming)

**Problem Statement:**
The problem is to determine the maximum profit that can be obtained by cutting a rod of a given length into smaller pieces, where each piece has a corresponding price and the total length of the rod is fixed.

**Approach (Tabulation):**

1. Create a 2D integer array **`dp`** of size **`(n + 1) × (totRod + 1)`**, where **`n`** is the number of available lengths and **`totRod`** is the total length of the rod.
    - **`dp[i][j]`** represents the maximum profit that can be obtained by cutting a rod of length **`j`** using the first **`i`** available lengths.
2. Initialize the base cases:
    - For **`i = 0`**, **`dp[0][j]`** should be **`0`** since there are no available lengths. (0th Row)
    - For **`j = 0`**, **`dp[i][0]`** should be **`0`** since the total length of the rod is 0. (0th Column)
3. Iterate over the available lengths and the total rod length using two nested loops:
    - For each available length **`length[i]`** at index **`i`** and each total rod length **`j`**:
        - Check if the current length **`length[i]`** is less than or equal to the total rod length **`j`**.
            - If it is valid to cut the rod of length **`j`** using the current length **`length[i]`**, calculate the maximum profit by including the current length:
                - The included profit is equal to the price of the current length **`price[i]`** plus the maximum profit obtained by cutting the remaining rod of length **`j - length[i]`**. Access this value using **`dp[i][j - length[i]]`**.
            - Calculate the maximum profit by excluding the current length:
                - The excluded profit is equal to the maximum profit obtained by considering the previous available lengths, which can be accessed using **`dp[i - 1][j]`**.
            - Take the maximum value between the included profit and the excluded profit and store it in **`dp[i][j]`**.
    - Repeat this process for all values of **`i`** and **`j`**.
4. After iterating over all available lengths and the total rod length, the value of **`dp[n][totRod]`** will represent the maximum profit that can be obtained by cutting the rod.
5. Return the value of **`dp[n][totRod]`**.

**Pseudocode:**

```
public static int rodCutting(int[] length, int[] price, int totRod) {
    int n = price.length;
    int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][totRod + 1];

    // Base case initialization
    for (int i = 0; i < dp.length; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = 0;
    }
    for (int j = 0; j < dp[0].length; j++) {
        dp[0][j] = 0;
    }

    // Tabulation
    for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j < totRod + 1; j++) {
            int v = price[i - 1];
            int w = length[i - 1];

            if (w <= j) { // Valid Condition
                int includeProfit = v + dp[i][j - w];
                int excludeProfit = dp[i - 1][j];
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(includeProfit, excludeProfit);
            } else { // Invalid Condition
                int excludeProfit = dp[i - 1][j];
                dp[i][j] = excludeProfit;
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n][totRod];
}public static int rodCutting(int[] length, int[] price, int totRod) {
        int n = price.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][totRod + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < dp.length; i++) { // 0th Column
            dp[i][0] = 0;
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < dp[0].length; j++) { // 0th Row
            dp[0][j] = 0;
        }
        //Tabulation LOOP
        for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < totRod + 1; j++) {
                int v = price[i - 1];
                int w = length[i - 1];
                if (w <= j) { //Valid Condition
                    int includeProfit = v + dp[i][j - w]; //Here is the only change instead of i-1 we use i as we can include the current item again and again
                    int excludeProfit = dp[i - 1][j];
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(includeProfit, excludeProfit);
                } else { //Unvalid Condition
                    int excludeProfit = dp[i - 1][j];
                    dp[i][j] = excludeProfit;
                }
            }
        }
//        printDP(dp); // printing DP for Clarification
        return dp[n][totRod];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
int[] length = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}; //Pieces Length
        int[] price = {1,5,8,9,10,17,17,20};
        int totRod = 8;

        System.out.println(rodCutting(length, price, totRod));
    }
```

**Dry Run:**
Given lengths: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Corresponding prices: [1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, 17, 20]
Total rod length: 8

- Initialize **`dp`** array:
    - Set **`dp[0][j] = 0`** for all **`j`** (0th Row)
    - Set **`dp[i][0] = 0`** for all **`i`** (0th Column)
- Tabulation:
    - For each available length **`length[i]`** and each total rod length **`j`**:
        - For **`i = 1`** (length 2):
            - For **`j = 1`** to **`8`**:
                - Since **`2 <= j`**, calculate the maximum profit by including the current length:
                    - The included profit is **`5`** (price[1]) plus the maximum profit obtained by cutting the remaining rod of length **`j - 2`** (dp[1][j - 2]).
                - Calculate the maximum profit by excluding the current length:
                    - The excluded profit is the maximum profit obtained by considering the previous available lengths, dp[0][j].
                - Take the maximum value between the included profit and the excluded profit and store it in dp[1][j].
            - Repeat this process for all values of **`j`**.
        - Repeat this process for the remaining available lengths.
- After completing the tabulation, the value of **`dp[8][8]`** is **`22`**, which represents the maximum profit that can be obtained by cutting the rod of length **`8`**.

**Note:**
The **`rodCutting(length, price, totRod)`** function call in the **`main`** method is used to calculate the maximum profit that can be obtained by cutting the rod of length **`totRod`** using the given lengths and prices.

        int n = price.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][totRod + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < dp.length; i++) { // 0th Column
            dp[i][0] = 0;
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < dp[0].length; j++) { // 0th Row
            dp[0][j] = 0;
        }
        //Tabulation LOOP
        for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < totRod + 1; j++) {
                int v = price[i - 1];
                int w = length[i - 1];
                if (w <= j) { //Valid Condition
                    int includeProfit = v + dp[i][j - w]; //Here is the only change instead of i-1 we use i as we can include the current item again and again
                    int excludeProfit = dp[i - 1][j];
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(includeProfit, excludeProfit);
                } else { //Unvalid Condition
                    int excludeProfit = dp[i - 1][j];
                    dp[i][j] = excludeProfit;
                }
            }
        }
//        printDP(dp); // printing DP for Clarification
        return dp[n][totRod];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
				int[] length = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}; //Pieces Length
        int[] price = {1,5,8,9,10,17,17,20};
        int totRod = 8;

        System.out.println(rodCutting(length, price, totRod));
    }
```
