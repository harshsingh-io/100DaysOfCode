## Key Concepts

**Minimum Partitioning Problem**:

Problem:
Given a set of integers, divide it into two subsets such that the difference between the sum of subsets is minimum.

Explanation:
The minimum partitioning problem is a variant of the 0-1 Knapsack problem. In this problem, we are given a set of integers, and our task is to divide the set into two subsets such that the difference between the sum of subsets is minimum. For example, suppose we have a set {1, 6, 11, 5}, and we want to divide it into two subsets. We can divide it into {1, 6} and {11, 5} subsets, and the difference between the sum of subsets is 1.

Approach:
We can solve the minimum partitioning problem using dynamic programming, and the approach is similar to the 0-1 Knapsack problem. We can use tabulation to build the dynamic programming table, and the subproblems can be defined as follows:

- dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum that can be obtained using the first i elements of the set such that the sum is less than or equal to j.

To fill the dp table, we can use the following conditions:

- If the ith element is included, then dp[i][j] = arr[i-1] + dp[i-1][j-arr[i-1]]
- If the ith element is not included, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]

We can use the formula dp[n][W], where n is the length of the set and W is the sum of all elements divided by 2, to get the maximum sum that can be obtained using the first n elements of the set.

Pseudo code according to the given code

```
function minPartition(arr)
    n = length(arr)
    sum = 0
    for i from 0 to n-1 do
        sum = sum + arr[i]
    end for
    W = sum / 2
    dp = 2D array of size (n+1) x (W+1)
    for i from 0 to n do // initialize 0th column
        dp[i][0] = 0
    end for
    for j from 0 to W do // initialize 0th row
        dp[0][j] = 0
    end for
    for i from 1 to n do // tabulation loop
        for j from 1 to W do
            if arr[i-1] <= j then // valid condition
                includeProfit = arr[i-1] + dp[i-1][j-arr[i-1]]
                excludeProfit = dp[i-1][j]
                dp[i][j] = max(includeProfit, excludeProfit)
            else // invalid condition
                excludeProfit = dp[i-1][j]
                dp[i][j] = excludeProfit
            end if
        end for
    end for
    sum1 = dp[n][W]
    sum2 = sum - sum1
    return absolute value of (sum1 - sum2)
end function
```

Note that this pseudocode follows the same logic as the given Java code, using a tabulation approach to solve the problem.

1. Define a function minPartition that takes an integer array arr as input and returns the minimum difference between the sum of two subsets.
2. Calculate the sum of all elements in the array.
3. Calculate W as sum/2.
4. Initialize a 2D array dp of size n+1 x W+1.
5. Initialize the 0th column of dp to 0.
6. Initialize the 0th row of dp to 0.
7. Use tabulation to fill the dp table:
a. For i = 1 to n, and j = 1 to W:
i. If arr[i-1] <= j, then includeProfit = arr[i-1] + dp[i-1][j-arr[i-1]] and excludeProfit = dp[i-1][j]
dp[i][j] = Math.max(includeProfit, excludeProfit)
ii. Else, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
8. Calculate the sum1 as dp[n][W].
9. Calculate sum2 as sum - sum1.
10. Return Math.abs(sum1 - sum2).
11. In the main function, create an integer array num and assign values to it.
12. Call the minPartition function with num as input and print the result.

## Code Snippets

```java
public class MinimumPartitioning {
    public static int minPartition(int[] arr) { // 0-1 Knapsack Code
        int n = arr.length;
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            sum += arr[i];
        }
        int W = sum / 2;
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][W + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < dp.length; i++) { // 0th Column
            dp[i][0] = 0;
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < dp[0].length; j++) { // 0th Row
            dp[0][j] = 0;
        }
        //Tabulation LOOP
        for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < W + 1; j++) {
                if (arr[i - 1] <= j) { //Valid Condition
                    int includeProfit = arr[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][j - arr[i - 1]];
                    int excludeProfit = dp[i - 1][j];
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(includeProfit, excludeProfit);
                } else { //Invalid Condition
                    int excludeProfit = dp[i - 1][j];
                    dp[i][j] = excludeProfit;
                }
            }
        }
        int sum1 = dp[n][W];
        int sum2 = sum - sum1;
        return Math.abs(sum1 - sum2);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] num = {1, 6, 11, 5};
        System.out.println(minPartition(num));
    }
}
```
