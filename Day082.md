### Implementing Color Layout Of Brush

In my drawing app, I have added a section that allows users to choose different colors for the brush. Let's go through the code step by step:

1. I have a **`LinearLayout`** with the ID **`ll_paint_colors`**. This layout is responsible for holding the color options for the brush. It is oriented horizontally, meaning the color buttons will be placed side by side.

```xml
<LinearLayout
    android:id="@+id/ll_paint_colors"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:background="@drawable/layout_curve"
    android:orientation="horizontal"
    app:layout_constraintBaseline_toTopOf="@id/ib_brush"
    app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="@id/drawing_view">
```

1. Inside the **`LinearLayout`**, you have multiple **`ImageButton`** elements, each representing a different color option for the brush. These buttons will allow the users to select their preferred brush color. Each button has the following attributes:
- **`android:layout_width`** and **`android:layout_height`** set to **`25dp`**, defining the size of the button.
- **`android:layout_margin`** set to **`5dp`**, adding a small margin around each button.
- **`android:background`** set to a specific color using the **`@color/...`** notation. This defines the background color of the button.
- **`android:onClick`** set to **`"paintClicked"`**. This indicates that when the button is clicked, the **`paintClicked()`** function in the **`MainActivity`** class will be invoked.
- **`android:src`** set to **`@drawable/pallete_normal`**, which defines the image source for the button. This can be a palette icon or any other image you desire.
- **`android:tag`** set to **`@color/...`**, representing the specific color associated with the button. This tag can be used to identify the color in the **`paintClicked()`** function.
1. For each color button, you can add additional **`ImageButton`** elements with the same structure, each with a different color value assigned to **`android:background`** and **`android:tag`**.
2. When a color button is clicked, the **`paintClicked()`** function in the **`MainActivity`** class will be triggered. You haven't shared the implementation of this function, but it should handle changing the brush color based on the selected button.

That's it! With this code, users of your drawing app can choose from multiple color options for the brush. When a color button is clicked, the **`paintClicked()`** function is invoked, allowing you to handle the brush color change accordingly.

The **`pallete_normal.xml`** file represents the background drawable for the color buttons in their normal state. It creates a visual effect of a circular palette with a border. Let's break down the code:

1. The root element of the XML file is a **`layer-list`**, which allows for layering multiple drawable items on top of each other.

```xml
<layer-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
```

1. Inside the **`layer-list`**, there are two **`item`** elements. Each **`item`** represents a layer in the drawable hierarchy.
2. The first **`item`** uses a **`rectangle`** shape with a border stroke. The stroke has a width of **`2dp`** and a color of **`#7B7B7B`**, which represents a gray shade.

```xml
<item>
    <shape android:shape="rectangle">
        <stroke
            android:width="2dp"
            android:color="#7B7B7B" />
        <padding
            android:bottom="0dp"
            android:left="0dp"
            android:right="0dp"
            android:top="0dp" />
    </shape>
</item>
```

1. The second **`item`** uses an **`oval`** shape, representing the circular shape of the palette. It has a border stroke similar to the first item. The solid color is set to **`#00000000`**, which represents transparent color.

```xml
<item>
    <shape android:shape="oval">
        <stroke
            android:width="2dp"
            android:color="#7B7B7B" />
        <solid android:color="#00000000" />
        <corners android:radius="250dp" />
    </shape>
</item>
```

1. The **`oval`** shape has rounded corners defined by **`android:radius="250dp"`**. This value can be adjusted to modify the roundness of the palette.

Overall, the **`pallete_normal.xml`** drawable creates a circular palette with a border stroke and rounded corners. It provides a visual representation of the color buttons in their normal state.

In the updated **`MainActivity.kt`** code, the color change functionality has been added. Let's go through the changes:

1. The **`paintClicked`** function is defined to handle the color change when a color button is clicked. It takes the clicked **`view`** as a parameter.

```kotlin
fun paintClicked(view: View) {
    if (view !== mImageButtonCurrentPaint) {
        val imageButton = view as ImageButton
        val colorTag = imageButton.tag.toString()
        drawingView?.setColor(colorTag)
        imageButton.setImageDrawable(
            ContextCompat.getDrawable(this, R.drawable.pallete_pressed)
        )
        mImageButtonCurrentPaint!!.setImageDrawable(
            ContextCompat.getDrawable(this, R.drawable.pallete_normal)
        )
        mImageButtonCurrentPaint = view
    }
}
```

Inside the function:

- The function checks if the clicked **`view`** is different from the currently selected color button (**`mImageButtonCurrentPaint`**).
- If they are different, it proceeds with the color change.
- It retrieves the **`colorTag`** from the clicked **`view`** using **`imageButton.tag.toString()`**. The **`colorTag`** represents the selected color.
- It sets the selected color in the **`DrawingView`** by calling **`drawingView?.setColor(colorTag)`**.
- It updates the background drawable of the clicked **`view`** to represent the selected state using **`imageButton.setImageDrawable(...)`**.
- It resets the background drawable of the previously selected color button (**`mImageButtonCurrentPaint`**) to represent the normal state.
- Finally, it updates **`mImageButtonCurrentPaint`** to the clicked **`view`**.
1. The **`paintClicked`** function is linked to the **`onClick`** attribute of each color button in the XML layout. When a color button is clicked, the **`paintClicked`** function is triggered.

With these changes, when a color button is clicked, the selected color is updated in the **`DrawingView`**, and the visual representation of the color buttons is adjusted to show the selected color button as pressed and the previously selected button as normal.

The **`pallete_pressed.xml`** file defines the XML drawable resource used to represent the pressed state of the color buttons. Here's a breakdown of its contents:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<layer-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <item>
        <shape android:shape="rectangle">
            <stroke
                android:width="2dp"
                android:color="#FF333333" />
            <padding
                android:bottom="0dp"
                android:left="0dp"
                android:right="0dp"
                android:top="0dp" />
        </shape>
    </item>
    <item>
        <shape android:shape="oval">
            <stroke
                android:width="2dp"
                android:color="#FF333333" />
            <solid android:color="#00000000" />
            <corners android:radius="250dp" />
        </shape>
    </item>
</layer-list>
```

Explanation of the XML structure:

- The root element is **`<layer-list>`**, which allows stacking multiple drawable items on top of each other.
- Inside the **`<layer-list>`**, there are two **`<item>`** elements, representing two drawable layers that will be drawn on top of each other.

First **`<item>`**:

- The shape of the drawable layer is defined as a **`<shape>`** element with the **`android:shape="rectangle"`** attribute.
- It has a **`<stroke>`** element that defines the width and color of the stroke or border around the rectangle shape.
- The **`<padding>`** element specifies the padding within the rectangle shape.

Second **`<item>`**:

- The shape of the drawable layer is defined as a **`<shape>`** element with the **`android:shape="oval"`** attribute.
- It also has a **`<stroke>`** element to define the width and color of the stroke or border around the oval shape.
- The **`<solid>`** element sets the solid color fill inside the oval shape. In this case, it uses a transparent color (**`#00000000`**).
- The **`<corners>`** element specifies the radius of the corners of the oval shape, giving it a circular appearance.

Overall, the **`pallete_pressed.xml`** drawable creates a visual representation for the pressed state of the color buttons by combining a rectangle shape with a stroke and an oval shape with a stroke and transparent fill. The stroke color is **`#FF333333`**, which represents a dark gray color.
