## Key Concepts

***MOUNTAIN VALLEY PAIR PROBLEM***

**Problem statement:** Given a sequence of upstrokes and downstrokes, find the maximum mountain and valley that can be formed. A mountain is a sequence of numbers that starts with an upstroke and ends with a downstroke, while a valley is a sequence of numbers that starts with a downstroke and ends with an upstroke.

**Brief explanation:** To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Catalan numbers. We can count the number of valid mountain and valley sequences that can be formed using n upstrokes and n downstrokes, where n is the number of pairs given. The number of valid mountain and valley sequences is equal to the nth Catalan number.

**Implementation and approach:** We can solve this problem using the tabulation approach of Catalan numbers. We can first count the number of upstrokes and downstrokes in the given sequence to determine the value of n. Then, we can use the tabulation approach to calculate the nth Catalan number. Finally, we can return the nth Catalan number as the maximum number of valid mountain and valley sequences that can be formed.

**Example:** For the input sequence 1, 2, 3, the number of upstrokes and downstrokes is both 3, so n = 3. The 3rd Catalan number is 5, which means there are 5 valid mountain and valley sequences that can be formed using this sequence of upstrokes and downstrokes. These sequences are:

- 1 2 3
- 1 3 2
- 2 1 3
- 3 1 2
- 3 2 1

Out of these sequences, the longest mountain and valley sequence is 3 1 2, which has a length of 3.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function countMountainValleyPairs(n):
    // Calculate the nth Catalan number
    catalan = calculateCatalan(n)

    // Return the number of mountain-valley pairs
    return catalan

function calculateCatalan(n):
    // Initialize an array to store the Catalan numbers
    catalan = new Array(n + 1)

    // Set the first two values of the array
    catalan[0] = 1
    catalan[1] = 1

    // Calculate the Catalan numbers from 2 to n
    for i from 2 to n:
        catalan[i] = 0
        for j from 0 to i-1:
            catalan[i] += catalan[j] * catalan[i-j-1]

    // Return the nth Catalan number
    return catalan[n]
```

In this pseudocode, **`countMountainValleyPairs`** is a function that takes an integer **`n`** as input and returns the number of mountain-valley pairs that can be formed with **`n`** upstroke-downstroke pairs. The function calls **`calculateCatalan`** to compute the nth Catalan number, which is the number of mountain-valley pairs that can be formed with **`n`** pairs.

The **`calculateCatalan`** function uses dynamic programming to compute the nth Catalan number. It first initializes an array **`catalan`** of size **`n + 1`** to store the Catalan numbers. It sets the first two values of the array to 1, since the 0th and 1st Catalan numbers are both 1. It then uses a loop to compute the remaining Catalan numbers from 2 to **`n`**, using the formula **`C(n) = C(0)*C(n-1) + C(1)*C(n-2) + ... + C(n-1)*C(0)`**. The function returns the nth Catalan number.

Note that the **`countMountainValleyPairs`** function simply calls **`calculateCatalan`** and returns its result, since the number of mountain-valley pairs is equal to the nth Catalan number.

## Code Snippets

```java
public class MountainRanges {
    public static int mountainRanges(int n){
        int [] dp = new int[n+1];
        dp[0]=dp[1]=1;
        for (int i=2;i<=n;i++){
            //Ci => i Up and Down Range Pair ->  Mountain Range == dp[i]
            for (int j=0;j<i;j++){
                int inside = dp[j]; // for Inside arrangement possible cases
                int outside = dp[i-j-1]; // for Outside arrangement possible cases
                dp[i]+=inside*outside; //Ci= Cj * Ci-j-1
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int pair = 3;
        System.out.println(mountainRanges(pair));
    }
}
```
