## Key Concepts

Segment Tree Query:

Segment tree is a data structure that enables fast querying on a range of values in an array. Given a query range [qi, qj], there are three cases that can occur:

1. Non-overlapping: If the query range [qi, qj] does not overlap with the range represented by the current segment [si, sj], the method returns 0. This is because the query range does not include any elements in the current segment and therefore their sum should not be included in the total sum.
2. Complete overlap: If the range [si, sj] is completely included in the query range [qi, qj], the method returns the sum of all elements in the current segment. This is because all the elements in the current segment are part of the query range and their sum should be included in the total sum.
3. Partial overlap: If the query range [qi, qj] partially overlaps with the range represented by the current segment [si, sj], the method traverses down the tree to the left and right child nodes and recursively calculates the sum of the subranges that overlap with the query range. The final result is the sum of the left and right subranges.

Types of Queries:

1. Range Sum Query: This type of query asks for the sum of all elements in a given range [l, r] of the original array. The segment tree can answer this query in O(log n) time, where n is the number of elements in the original array. The algorithm for range sum query is as follows:
    
    Algorithm: getSumUtil(i, si, sj, qi, qj)
    
    1. If the query range [qi, qj] does not overlap with the current segment [si, sj], return 0.
    2. If the range [si, sj] is completely included in the query range [qi, qj], return the sum of all elements in the current segment.
    3. If the query range [qi, qj] partially overlaps with the current segment [si, sj], recursively calculate the sum of the left and right subranges and return their sum.
2. Range Minimum Query: This type of query asks for the minimum element in a given range [l, r] of the original array. The segment tree can answer this query in O(log n) time, where n is the number of elements in the original array. The algorithm for range minimum query is as follows:
    
    Algorithm: getMinUtil(i, si, sj, qi, qj)
    
    1. If the query range [qi, qj] does not overlap with the current segment [si, sj], return infinity.
    2. If the range [si, sj] is completely included in the query range [qi, qj], return the value at the current segment.
    3. If the query range [qi, qj] partially overlaps with the current segment [si, sj], recursively calculate the minimum of the left and right subranges and return their minimum.
3. Range Maximum Query: This type of query asks for the maximum element in a given range [l, r] of the original array. The segment tree can answer this query in O(log n) time, where n is the number of elements in the original array. The algorithm for range maximum query is as follows:
    
    Algorithm: getMaxUtil(i, si, sj, qi, qj)
    
    1. If the query range [qi, qj] does not overlap with the current segment [si, sj], return -infinity.
    2. If the range [si, sj] is completely included in the query range [qi, qj], return the sum, minimum, or maximum (depending on the type of query) of all elements in the current segment.
    3. If the query range [qi, qj] partially overlaps with the range represented by the current segment [si, sj], traverse down the tree to the left and right child nodes and recursively calculate the sum, minimum, or maximum of the subranges that overlap with the query range. The final result is the sum, minimum, or maximum of the left and right subranges.

## Code Snippets

```java
public class SegmentTrees {
    static int[] tree;

    public static void init(int n) {
        tree = new int[4 * n];
    }

    public static int buildST(int[] arr, int i, int start, int end) {
        if (start == end) {
            tree[i] = arr[start];
            return arr[start];
        }
        int mid = (start + end) / 2;
        buildST(arr, 2 * i + 1, start, mid);
        buildST(arr, 2 * i + 2, mid + 1, end);
        tree[i] = tree[2 * i + 1] + tree[2 * i + 2];
        return tree[i];
    }

    public static int getSumUtil(int i, int si, int sj, int qi, int qj) {
        if (qj <= si || qi >= sj) { //non overlapping
            return 0;
        } else if (si >= qi && sj <= qj) { //complete overlap
            return tree[i];
        } else { //partial overlap
            int mid = (si + sj) / 2;
            int left = getSumUtil(2 * i + 1, si, mid, qi, qj);
            int right = getSumUtil(2 * i + 2, mid + 1, sj, qi, qj);
            return left + right;
        }
    }

    public static int getSum(int[] arr, int qi, int qj) {
        int n = arr.length;
        return getSumUtil(0, 0, n - 1, qi, qj);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
        int n = arr.length;
        init(n);
        buildST(arr, 0, 0, n - 1);
//        for (int i = 0; i < tree.length; i++) {
//            System.out.print(tree[i] + " ");
//        }
        System.out.println(getSum(arr, 2, 5));
    }
}
```
